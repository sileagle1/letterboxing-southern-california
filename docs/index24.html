                        Hiya! 

Does anyone know who is the owner of the Campfire Girl Hitch Hiker?

                        Gwen & I had the opportunity to taste some Duck Soup today. Great 
clues and a nice hike. Lots of folks have hit this box.

We are going to be out of touch for about 3 weeks as Dartmoor is 
calling....

                        Hello All,

I haven't heard anything about this box for awhile, so stopped by to
check on it after swimming lessons.  It's definitely missing. I found
the lid to the box and half of a clue sheet....

                        Although I don't have any hard evidence to back this up, it seems that 
amount of letterboxing going on int SoCal is less during the summer 
months than any other season.  Is it because of the heat?...
