I know it is cold and unboxable in many areas right now, but a few of 
the racers have made it to the East coast, and I thought it warranted 
an update!

I replaced my Halloween Series #1 box, Suicide Bridge. This time it's 
double-bagged, so we'll see how the last 24 hours of rain have 
treated the new logbook.
