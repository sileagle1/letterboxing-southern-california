                        Amanda swears there used to be a letterbox on Santa Catalina Island,

such boxes?  Dead and gone?  Or just in hiding?

                        OK Buzzard, how about this Sat? Is there anyone else who would like 
to meet or is there another day that would be better for everyone. 
Seems like it should be a beautiful weekend. Purple Iris

                        I just got a report that the Hitchhiking Ghost box was the victim of either of critters or inclement weather and the stamp is missing. :(

I'll be heading out this week to see what I can salvage.

                        Hi Buzzard,
Did you ever manage to get over to find this box? If not and you 
still want to try I'd still like to meet with you. Maybe we can get a 
few more people and do a stamp in. Purple Iris.

                        Hi All,

We visited Buzzard's Leap Year Box in Victory Park today, it's alive
and well.  The cherry trees are in bloom, so it must be time for the
annual Cherry Blossom Festival! ...
