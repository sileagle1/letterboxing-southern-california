                        So, I just wanted to get an idea who will be contributing boxes to plant in Chino Hills.  I wanted to go with a desert theme and have a few people donating already.  Let me know.

                        I finally replaced these again today.  I figured I'd have to toot my own horn, because it's been so long, probably nobody would ever look at the clues if I didn't mention it.

                        New Year's letterbox "Times Long Since" is back in place in La Canada until February.
