&gt; Thank you, Jim -- <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We're involved in Boy Scouts, and you may or may not be aware that they offer a Geocaching Merit Badge.  One of the dads in our Troop has begun teaching the boys about Geocaching, and plans to take them(us) on an outing at South Hills Park, on March 2nd.  He himself was fairly unaware of the existence of Letterboxing, and when he planned the trip, I encouraged him to also educate they boys that Letterboxes also exist, how to recognize them as different from Geocaches, and also how differently they should be treated.  He thought that was a good idea, and he said that, in South Hills Park, in addition to the many geocaches there, there seemed to be a letterbox there (he wasn't entirely sure it was a letterbox; I suggested it might turn out to be a hybrid of the two).  HE found it listed on the geocaching.com  website, but I have yet to successfully peruse the list of geocaches in Glendora.  I did find BE PREPARED a few days ago, on LbNA, but it looked to me as though it might have already gone missing.  Will research further -- and will let you know what we find (or don't)!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks again,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Look for "Be Prepared!", LbNA #54547.  I went hiking in that park with a friend, late last Spring.  While in the middle of going after geocaches, we followed the clues, but made a mistake somewhere, and never did find the correct walnut tree.  Have to go back, some day.<br/>

&gt; &gt; There is a lot of room for more boxes in that park, but be aware that there are about 15 geocaches already in there.  It should be very easy to find places where boxes won't be in conflict with them, especially if you put the standard "This is NOT a geocache!" warning on them.  If we lived a bit closer, we'd put in one or two.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many thanks for posting this!  I suspect that most of the improvements will be on the north side of the park, where there already is a playground area, plus a lot of open space that is under-utilized.  I doubt that most of the caches and LBs that are in the park will be affected, as they are mostly higher up, but a couple of them might be affected by a trail that goes all around the park, which I think is a great idea of them to put in.  I'll mention this to the people who I know could be affected by this.  And anyone who wants to add to the current population of hidden stuff should keep these future changes in mind.<br/>
