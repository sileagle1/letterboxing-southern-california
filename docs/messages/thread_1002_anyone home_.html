I posted a message last week asking for feedback on selection of markers.  Did I say something that I shouldn't have?  I didn't get one response and now I am getting paranoid.....hahahah.<br/>
<br/>
I know y'all are busy so I will just hope that when you have a minute you might share your thoughts/opinions on this.  Trying to build some supplies for the Joshua Tree event.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for an apartment in the valley that is dog friendly.  Yes, I do live in PS, but my partner and I maintain an apt in Eagle Rock as well.  It is an in-law and we need to let it go as the owners of the house have sold it.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for a studio or 1 bedroom.  If anyone has or knows of anything can you shoot me a message?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Looking forward to seeing some of you in May.  Woo Hoo<br/>

Anyway, my favorite is "Artist's Loft", followed by "Art Performance" - however, these tend to be at least a full inch longer than the "Loft".<br/>
 <br/>
The other thing I like about the Loft are the caps.  They go on with a definite click that lets me know it is sealed<br/>
I know lots of people like La Plume (?)<br/>

Recently bought some called "American Crafts brand Stamp Marker" got them cheap and they are okay - you get what you pay for :-)<br/>

Hope that helps - Ratty<br/>

I've also bought Marvy "Wet Looks Embossing Markers". They're ok...but don't care for them as much.<br/>
See you in May!!!<br/>
Love....Cherry :)<br/>
