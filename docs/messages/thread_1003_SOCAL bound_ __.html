Hints? ideas?<br>
Also will have two teenagers with me making a quick stop in Hollywood. Any super worthwhile boxes even nonboxing teenagers might like?<br>

If you have time the Daruma box in Little Tokyo has been a BOTW and includes a nice walking tour. It might be on your way if you're taking the 10 from Hollywood to PS, but you don't want to get stuck in rush hour traffic on that route.  ;-)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Those are both good suggestions, but make sure to look at the comments on Alfalfa, and the seperate Fay Wray listing by What What.<br>
<br>
Don't forget In-N-LAX for a quick drive by, if you can park by it to hide what you're doing. If not, it may not be quick since there are lots of eyes.<br>
<br>
And not to toot my own horn, but if you take the 60 instead out to Riverside, my One Man's Trash... box will be a cool location to even the most jaded teen.<br>
