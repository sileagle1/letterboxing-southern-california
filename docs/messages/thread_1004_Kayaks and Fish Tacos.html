The conversation started with what boxes she's wanting to hunt out here, and number one on her list is Heron And Tinman by Don & Gwen.  So I'm thinking we'll head down to Long Beach on Sunday to rent some kayaks, then head to Hol Mol for some fish tacos.  A friend of her husband recommended some place in downtown LA, so we decided to compare a few places and determine who makes the best fish tacos.<br>

So who's interested in a dinnertime meet and greet in Long Beach?  And who wants to go the extra mile and join us for an afternoon kayak adventure?<br>

I have the 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st tentatively "free" . . . . . well, let me put it this way - I have a TON of stuff I should be doing, planting several boxes - and listing them - at the top of that long list . . . but heck, how often does an old Dezert Rat get in a kayak?<br>
  <br>
Maybe I could get a two man and have my son do all the paddling???<br>

I might be up for this.  I have never gone for that box and would be better to <br>
do it with others.  What time are you thinking of going?  Marco has pinewood <br>
