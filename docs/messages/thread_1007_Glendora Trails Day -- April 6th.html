<br>
1) Hoping to get a few of our Boy Scout troop members out to help with this (South Hills Park, Glendora), but I was also thinking --<br>
<br>
2) Am wondering if it might be advisable to protect "our" two local letterboxes there by removing them a day or two before the cleanup event and replacing them afterwards.<br>
<br>
3) What are your thoughts on the advisability of this course of action?<br>
<br>
4) Anybody else want to come out and help maintain trails at South Hills Park?  <br>
<br>
I think it goes from 8am to noon.  I have a flyer, but it isn't handy just now.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
