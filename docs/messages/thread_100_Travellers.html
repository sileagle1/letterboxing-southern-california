JugglerMouse has two very impressive stamps that you can only get by <br/>
finding a certain number of her Redwall Series stamps--then finding <br/>
her.  I highly recommend both of these activities.  <br/>

I wasn't aware that there was a web site that was set up to track personal travelers. The only person that we have come across that had one was Silent Doug and the only code he used was that you had to ask him for it. Sorry about the delay in responding as we are on the road and have limited web access.<br/>

you just have to find them by word of mouth. I will give you a hint <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I never even heard of a personal traveller until I started meeting up <br/>
with letterboxers on the east coast.  It seems to be MUCH more common <br/>
out there and any gathering with more than ten people is likely to <br/>
have several personal travellers in the area.  But it's always a word-<br/>
of-mouth thing where you have to say or do something specicial to get <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Let's see....  Jay Drew requires an English salute or something like <br/>
that.  I wasn't sure what that was when I met him, so I tried a <br/>
regular old USA salute which did the trick.<br/>
<br/>
Music Woman requires you to answer a specific question that she'll <br/>
ask you.  Actually, the question is where did she used to work, but <br/>
she gives you an interesting hint to help figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
Juggler Mouse requires you to find a couple of previous boxes and <br/>
show proof of finding them.  (Technically, I think Juggler Mouse has <br/>
one and Sir B has the other, but both require the finding of two of <br/>
the Redwall series before they'll give 'em up.)<br/>
<br/>
Ever since I learned about personal travellers I've been thinking of <br/>
making one for myself, although I want to do something that makes <br/>
people feel rediculous in the process.  You know--make them WORK for <br/>
it.  =)  I like to make my stamps difficult to acquire.  My favorite <br/>
idea I've thought of so far is a two step process:<br/>
<br/>
1. A letterboxer walks up to me and says, "Toro! Toro!"<br/>
<br/>
I'd whip out a bright, red handkerchief I have in my pocket and hold <br/>
it up like a bullfighter.  Then step 2:<br/>
<br/>
2. The letterboxer must pretend to make fake horns with their fingers <br/>
and charge the hanky.  A roar would be nice, but is optional.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, the PT would have to be of a bull or something equally <br/>
appropriate.  =)<br/>
