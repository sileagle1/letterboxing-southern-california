                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings members of the Rebel Alliance!<br/>
<br/>
The Questmobile was stuck in hyper drive and I was unable to correspond - but I have finally landed back at the home base and wanted to say a Great BIG THANK YOU to MrOspital for an outstanding adventure!<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I was stuck manning Rebel Outpost 22 and was unable to visit with most of you back at the Rebel Base Camp, but when I was able to come in it looked like everyone was having a great time.<br/>
<br/>
It was so nice to see some new faces amid all the familiar Rebels!<br/>
<br/>
I never did get to "exchange" with them -- but will someday soon I hope. <br/>
<br/>
I also want to take the time to Thank CherryonTop and MrOspital for the many hours they put into flying top secret missions into dangerous territories to hide all of those outstanding boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Without them -- this would have just been another camping trip on a desert planet!<br/>
<br/>
There were some awesome carves hidden out there  - as DV would say -- "Impressive . .. Most Impressive"!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who brought in food and supplies.  I'm not sure of who brought what, but I do know that the parfait CI Clueso made, with the hand whipped cream, was a delicious hit and received the "Italian" seal of approval. <br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmmmmmmmm ate it I did!<br/>
<br/>
The Night Exercises (night boxing) put on by Lee and MrOspital, were also a hit and helped train the young Padawans among us -- using the Force to guide them fearlessly forward - as well as the occasional light saber- they proved themselves worthy to join the Jedi ranks.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday night, when cyclonic gale forces hit the planet surface, I understand that some of the Rebels were forced to retreat -- do not be ashamed -- it is better to retreat and live to fight the Imperial Forces another day then to be blown away in a flimsy tent! <br/>
<br/>
I also want to thank all of you that donated to the Rebel Base Fund (camping fees)  I would like to report that due to your generosity not only was I able to pay back my Noxer for his willingness to secure the secret location of the Rebel Base (camping sites) -- but I was able to hand over the excess to Base Commander (MrOspital) to help cover a small portion of his expenses.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there is someone I am forgetting to thank, but you will forgive this old scruffy nerf herder I hope<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Thank you to all for another great adventure and May the Force be with you!!<br/>
<br/>
PS: <br/>
I forgot to mention -it was nice to find out the JTNP website was incorrect and that we did not have to pay the $15 per transporter fee just to enterinto Rebel airspace and that the Weather website was incorrect as well. <br/>
Fortunately for all, the planet never did reach the boiling point! <br/>
