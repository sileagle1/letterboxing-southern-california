Just a few of you met oj drinker from MA when she was here in 2011.  She will be in LA for a few days for a wedding and wants to make boxing plans with the locals on either the 7th and/or 9th.<br>
<br>
Thunderbird from WA will be in San Diego while her kid attends Comic-Con from the 17th to the 21st.  She'd like to maybe box with some folks down there, but also will likely make it up to the LA/OC area at some point.<br>

Who's interested?  Who's available?  Does anyone from down in San Diego County still chime in on this board?<br>
