Swimming in Sierra Madre<br/>
<br/>
Your destination is Sierra Vista Park in the lovely city of Sierra<br/>
Madre.  Exit the 210 freeway at Santa Anita.  Drive north 0.9 miles to<br/>
Sierra Madre Blvd., the second stop sign.  Turn left and drive 0.2<br/>
miles, the park is on your right.  Carefully look for the first of<br/>
three driveways into the parking lot, after the tan "Sierra Madre City<br/>
Limit" sign.  The second driveway is an exit only.  Dogs and kids are<br/>
welcome.  Wheelchairs will need to do a little off-roading, but it's<br/>
not impossible.  Stop by the Recreational Center to find out more<br/>
about all of the fun events and classes in the area.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
I spy something reddish brown.<br/>
  A brick building!  Walk past the front of all the brick buildings<br/>
and around the corner. <br/>
<br/>
I spy something blue.<br/>
  A swimming pool!  Can you imagine swimming under the stars?  Walk<br/>
past the pool and up the hill.<br/>
<br/>
I spy something silver.<br/>
  A chain link fence!  Can you hear the happy sounds of playing dogs?<br/>
You're standing in front of a park just for dogs. Turn right and walk<br/>
along the chain link fence past the Dog Park.<br/>
<br/>
I spy something yellow.<br/>
  A slide!  Walk past the playground keeping the wall on your left.<br/>
<br/>
I spy something red.<br/>
  A "No Parking" sign!?!  Walk up the hill keeping the sign on your<br/>
right.  Don't stop to rest at the two benches underneath the Wisteria<br/>
vine.<br/>
<br/>
I spy something gray.<br/>
  A gravel path!  Walk downhill along the gravel path.  Which way now?<br/>
<br/>
I spy something green.<br/>
  An arch of green bushes!  Walk through the arch and sit on the bench.<br/>
<br/>
I spy something white and black and gray.<br/>
  A heavy granite rock!  Lift up the rock sitting at the end of the bench.<br/>
<br/>
I spy a letterbox!<br/>
  Enjoy the Lillian Burke Memorial Garden as you stamp in.  Walk<br/>
downhill past the Sierra Madre Community Nursery School to find your car.<br/>

Thank you Spacy Holly &amp; Family for another great letterbox. I managed <br/>
to be first finder of this box, which always gives me a little <br/>
thrill.  The location of this box was oddly familiar--as if another <br/>
letterbox was hidden nearby??!.  The stamp itself was beautifully <br/>
carved, and inspires me to do a better carving next time.  Thanks for <br/>
a beautiful Thanksgiving Day letterbox adventure.<br/>
