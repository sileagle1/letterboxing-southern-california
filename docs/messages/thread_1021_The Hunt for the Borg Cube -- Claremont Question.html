                    <html><body><p>I can't speak for *current* conditions, but I and a friend found that LB a couple of years ago, on 28 June, 2012.  It was in excellent condition, as I recall, although it took a bit of searching to come up with it.  It isn't really all that far from parking, which information is detailed in the LB write-up.  I *do* recall that the LB write-up did not take into account a side-trail which will make it a bit easier to get to the target object, but you likely will go beyond the target.  My log is the last one on LbNA, and as this box is not listed on AQ, only those willing to be Olde School will find the listing.<br/><br/>As for rattlesnakes, they should not be feared.  They tend to avoid humans; if you encounter them, they will go away from you if you give them an avenue to do so.  They do a great job of keeping the rodent population down, and deserve our appreciation.  Foregoing a hike *solely* because one "might" encounter a rattlesnake would be unfortunate, IMHO.  This, of course, presumes that dogs will not be along; dogs, even on leash, just aren't smart enough to leave a snake alone, even if it is slithering away.<br/><br/>Hope you find the Cube, whenever you go!<br/><br/>Jim, the other half of chaosmanor</p></body></html>
