                    <div class="plaintext-content">I planted this box in August in Rancho Cuyamaca State Park near Julian. I just looked at the official State Park website and it sounds like the whole park is pretty much destroyed so I don't have a lot of hope of the box having survived.  :(<br>
<br>
The Park is currently closed so there is no way for anyone to get in and confirm whether it is there anymore.<br>
<br>
Even sadder than the probable loss of the box is the complete destruction of historical structures that were built in the 30s by the Conservation Corps.<br>
