On the LBCA group, there is now a poll asking whether the SoCal and <br>
LBCA list should be combined, and since not everyone on this list is <br>
participating in the LBCA list, you all might not know that a vote is <br>
underway, and your input is important. Please go to <br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbCA/surveys?id=11478196 and vote <br>
whether or not the two groups should be combined. I voted to combine <br>
the groups. Though I love our little SoCal group, I think we need to <br>
be inclusive, and where are the Central California letterboxers going <br>
to post, since they are midway between the two of us!<br>

*chuckle*  It would be part of Northern California!  =)  Or maybe it <br>
would have to be called the Central & Northern California board.  The <br>
C&N board.  (Not to be mistaken with CNN.)<br>
<br>
Oh, gosh, I'm feeling tired....  But seriously, if ya'll vote for <br>
keeping two separate boards, I guess we'd have to vote again about <br>
where exactly the dividing line should be.  And if the vote shows to <br>
have a single California board, we should vote for which board should <br>
be the merger and which would be the mergee.  Decisions, decisions....<br>
<br>
About half the members on the LbCA talk list have voted and it's tied <br>
between merger or seperate boards.  Looks like the decision is as <br>
controversial for you guys as it is for myself!  =)  <br>

Taking another look at the poll questions, if I'm reading it right, <br>
the first two questions would result in the same outcome--a single <br>
California list. I assume the name of the single list would change <br>
to just California Letterboxing Group, so it's just a matter of <br>
whether you or California Bear are the owner, and I would think <br>
either of you would be fine with the rest of us.  So the score is <br>
really 8 votes to merge into one California group, and 5 votes to <br>
keep them separate.<br>

Hi Buzzard,<br>
I went to this site and it seems you can only vote if you are a <br>
member. I would prefer to remain just a So Cal board with Califronia <br>
Bear as owner. Purple Iris<br>

The polling feature doesn't work unless it can track who's voted for <br>
what.  Otherwise someone could come in and vote a hundred times if <br>
they wanted to.  So yes, membership is required.  It's not an <br>
unreasonable request (at least I think so) that anyone interested in <br>
the subject enough to vote SHOULD be a member.<br>
<br>

<br>
I'll keep that in mind and add a "virtual" vote for you.  It won't <br>
show up in the official poll, but I'll keep the additional vote in <br>
mind.<br>

<br>
Hmm....  Definitely need to clear up any confusion for the vote to <br>
count!  =)<br>
<br>
Keep in mind the question is "What should be done with this talk <br>
list?", as in the talk list where the poll was created.  So the first <br>
option is a vote for creating one, single California talk list that <br>
encompasses the entire state.  This could mean destroying both of the <br>
existing boards and started a new group from scratch, or deleting <br>
either of the existing boards and moving everyone over to the other <br>
one.  Those details would be worked out after this vote is done, <br>
though.<br>
<br>
The second option is a vote for my changing the board I created into <br>
a Northern California board only (or rather, any area not covered by <br>
the Southern California board--including Central California).  The <br>
Southern California board would continue as it always has with no <br>
changes at all.  (Probably what most people on this board prefer--<br>
especially if they don't get out of Southern California much.)<br>
<br>
There's no right or wrong answer--just personal preferences and in <br>
the quest for making as many people possible happy with the decision, <br>
I thought I'd put it up for a vote.  No decision will make everyone <br>
happy, unfortnately.  In fact, even doing NOTHING will make some <br>
people unhappy.  It's the worst case of a lose-lose-lose situation <br>
I've ever been a part of.  But at least the stakes aren't very high.  <br>
=)  Oh, if only I created a Northern Letterboxing board from day 1 <br>
and none of this conflict would have started in the first place.  <br>
*sigh*<br>
<br>

<br>
That's very kind, but I know there are a few people out there that <br>
cringe at the thought of me being in charge of a board.  =)  If <br>
there's to be a single California board, I'll give up ownership to <br>
California Bear (who nobody--as far as I know--has a grudge against) <br>
and would be happy with a moderator status.  In fact, he already made <br>
me a moderator for this board, so I've been approving members that <br>
want to join.  I haven't had to delete any inappropriate posts, <br>
though.<br>

I do love our little SoCal group, which has more active postings then <br>
the Northern California group, probably because we're all newbies and <br>
are so excited about our new hobby.<br>

Well . . . that did cross my mind when I made my post, but since you <br>
have no boxes placed down here, I assumed you didn't visit us that <br>
much, and hadn't had the opportunity to piss anyone off. ;-)<br>

What?!  Of course I have boxes in Southern California!  =)  If you <br>
ever head out for the Lone Oak Tree letterbox, let it be known, I hid <br>
that box at the Circle X Ranch.  =)  My dad lives in Southern <br>
California (Camarillo to be exact) so I do, on rare occasions, head <br>
out to the area to visit him.  (The last time was when I hid that <br>
letterbox, in fact.)  And I used to live in Simi Valley--a place <br>
where an uncle now lives.  Plus a whole mess of distant relatives <br>
that I don't really know, but I've been to a family reunion or two in <br>
the LA area for that reason.  And LAX is one of the more common <br>
airports I travel through--so I'm in the area quite often for someone <br>
that doesn't actually live there.  =)<br>
<br>
And I will return again and again and.....  MUHAHAHaHahahaha!!!!!<br>
