                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's a heads up for the Socal folks. Opening soon will be the first(we believe) 8 hole Stamp Golf course. Now some folks are probably wondering why 8 holes ? It's Stamp Golf that's why. Professional stampers , talented amateurs and beginers are all welcome to participate. To start off the Stamp Golf season the "Long Beach Classic" will bring players from near and far. We are currently looking for corporate sponsors as well as the "hottest" players. Tune, up your stamping abilities. Polish your compass , and sharpen your hunting senses, it's comming soon. Don and Gwen<br>
