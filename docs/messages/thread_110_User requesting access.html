There was another notice on the main chat list recently that was posted to solicit participation in a new letterboxing web site. I went to the site and the two moderators were something like "letterboxingking and freesomething or other". I then went to letterbox search and tried to pull up their names on the placer list. There are no such names listed or at least this investigator wasn't able to locate them. While they may be letterboxers my guess is that they wish to use the chat list to further their own product of yet another data base or such. <br>

  Does anyone know of a letterboxer who goes by the e-mail address of <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think so.  I got another request for access that had a name of poopygussets (a gusset being a triangle of clost used tyo reinforce a seam, such as the one found around the crotch area of pants.)  The name also didn't match the e-mail at all, another warning flag in my book. That one got the heave-ho without the courtesy of a questioning e-mail.<br>
