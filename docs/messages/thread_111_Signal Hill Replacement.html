I have always meant to get over to Signal Hill to get this box, does <br>
your replacement mean the original went missing?  Is the new stamp <br>
the same as the old?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The public works department for Signal Hill removed the old Rosemary shrubs, and in doing so the letterbox was probably removed as trash. The new stamp is nearly the same, the old image was a negative carve and the new one a positive carve. The new stamp and letterbox are slightly larger. We have changed the clues to meet the new location. We had to remove the old log last may as it was completely filled, so we may plop it back in the letterbox if we get a chance. Right now you could be first to stamp in the new log. We replaced the wet log at "White by Day, Blue at Night" last night ,and night time would be a great time for either of these boxes!!!<br>
