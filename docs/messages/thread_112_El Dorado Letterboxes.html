Since the locations of Wm.Tell's Target and At Bat were pretty iffy we will not be replacing them. #1 Nature Center will be replaced in the future but in another location in the center. All of those that were still in their locations have had visitations but it seems as though Elvis has given folks the most trouble. You know how elusive the king could be.<br/>
