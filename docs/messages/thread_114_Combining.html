                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm going to post this on both California Talk Lists which tends to <br>
point out the problem. Since the chit chat traffic on either one or <br>
both of the lists is not impacted it makes some sense (at least to <br>
me) that maybe a 6 month trial of one list only would be of some <br>
value. There are presently 16 members that are members of both lists. <br>
There are 14 members of the California list that do not belong to the <br>
SoCal list. There are 9 members of the SoCal list that do not belong <br>
to the California list. For simplicity those 9 SoCalers would join <br>
their fellow letterboxers (fellow is not being used as a sexest term)<br>
on the California site and then see how it goes for 6 months. If at <br>
the end of 6 months the membership increases and the talk list gets <br>
impacted then split it up. If we get a flame out maybe it would <br>
happen sooner, but I believe one list should have a trial run. I <br>
realize the poll was created to have a democratic solution but I'm <br>
not sure that some folks have really given a fair shake to the idea <br>
of one list. Since there are 23 folks that do not share both <br>
lists ,those 23 may not realize that having one list will not change <br>
much for them. Those that receive both lists should realize that the <br>
one California list will make their life just a little less <br>
complicated. At least you will be able to keep it straight which list <br>
you are communicating on.  Don<br>
