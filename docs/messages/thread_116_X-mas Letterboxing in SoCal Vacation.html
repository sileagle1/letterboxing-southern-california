                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can't speak for the boxes down Carlsbad way but I can give a couple of<br/>
hints for LA County boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on how far into LA County you want to go, I would definitely<br/>
recommend the Descanso Gardens series.  The setting is beautiful and the<br/>
stamps are all really nice.<br/>
<br/>
In southern LA County, there is the Strange Stamps series in Santa Fe<br/>
Springs.  I liked those.  They are all pretty close together and are pretty<br/>
unique.<br/>
<br/>
There is also the El Dorado Park series.  That one has 6 or 7 stamps (I<br/>
can't recall exactly at the moment).  If you want a little bit of a<br/>
challenge, try and find Elvis of El Dorado.  He is notoriously elusive.  I<br/>
looked for him three times before I finally found him.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for a challenging series that will suck up a whole day,<br/>
do the Seal Beach Town Tour.  This one will have you cross eyed before you<br/>
are done but you will feel a real sense of accomplishment when you finish<br/>
it.  So far, no one has collected all seven of these (although I am getting<br/>
REALLLY close).<br/>
<br/>
Some single stamps that have some nice features are the Crystal Cove/Moro<br/>
Canyon box (Orange County).  That one is a little bit of a hike but has some<br/>
nice views of the ocean.  The Palo Verde and Point Vicente Lighthouse boxes<br/>
(LA County) both have nice ocean views.<br/>
<br/>
While you are in the area, perhaps you would like to meet up with some of us<br/>
for an exchange.  Let us know when you are going to be out looking and maybe<br/>
some of us could meet you somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

In Carlsbad proper (where I was raised) there is only one letterbox, <br/>
and I believe it's still in place--the Batiquitos Lagoon Letterbox.  <br/>
On the LBNA Web site, there are other LBs listed in San Diego County, <br/>
but I've never visited them, so couldn't give you any up-to-date <br/>
information as to whether they are still in place or not.<br/>
<br/>
If you make a trip to the Los Angeles area, there are so many great <br/>
boxes located up here that I'm very familiar with.  Look on the LBNA <br/>
Website for these boxes:<br/>
"El Dorado Series"<br/>
"Long Beach State Letterboxes"<br/>
"The Halloween Series"<br/>
"Pasadena Humane Society"<br/>
"Strange Stamp Series at Heritage Park"<br/>
"The Other Canyons Series"<br/>
"The Lizard Crossing"<br/>
"Seal Beach Town Tour"<br/>
"Biking in Lacy Park"<br/>
"Swimming in Sierra Madre"<br/>
"The Naples Canal Conundrum" and "The Marina Pacifica Plumbing <br/>
Problem"<br/>
<br/>
There are so many more great boxes up here planted by The Mandrill, <br/>
and the Gnosis 4-H Club, and others, and I don't mean to insult all <br/>
the other great letterboxes by not mentioning them in this post--it's <br/>
just that there are too many to list--these are just a few of the <br/>
great boxes that I've found, and believe to still be in place.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's my 2 cents - For the Carlsbad area you might try Los Penaquitos Waterfall, it's a hike and it has been about two years since we were there so status is unknown. La Jolla Letterbox is not a very long hike and has great views, verified there on 11/8/2003 as was Batiquitos Lagoon. Jack Creek Falls is one of ours and we received a "found" note about 3 months ago. If we have any rain then Jack Creek Falls would be really great and it is nearly a drive by. LA area would be dependant on which area you would want to hit as there are groupings in Pasadena, Arcadia ,Whittier, Long Beach and some in various parts of Orange County. Probably the best thing would be to get an LA map and figure out which area would be the most fun to hit. Ca. Bear is right about Seal Beach Town Tour it will consume most of one day. If you really want a challenge you can be the first to attempt Stamp Golf in Long Beach it has been in place since October and no one has yet to even try it.<br/>

The Batiquitos Lagoon is a very scenic box and worth the visit even if not found!! but it was there earlier this year. <br/>

The Discovery Lake box in San Marcos was also found recently but I did think it was in danger of being found by non boxers or gardeners but again worth the trip. <br/>
