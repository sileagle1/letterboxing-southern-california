Thanks for the great suggestions.  I will post back and let everyone <br>
know where we were able to go.  I am reluctant to try and make plans <br>
to meet for an exchange since our plans are really up in the air with <br>
her family.  We are hoping to get out for a little bit, that's why we <br>
wanted to know what you guys considered the best of the area.  <br>
Hopefully over time and future trips we will be able to visit more <br>
boxes.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the great info, we can't wait.<br>
<br>
Tiger & BuzzBee<br>
