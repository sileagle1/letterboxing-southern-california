Happy Holidays to everyone, and I wish a quick recovery for our <br>

P.S. By the term "sick man" I mean a man not feeling well--thought I <br>
should clarify that. ;-D<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since Christmas shopping is getting close to finally being over for <br>
this year, many folks are stressed to the breaking point. If that is <br>
the case then read on, and try to figure out what ornament you are <br>
planning for the top of your tree.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Angel Atop The Christmas Tree.<br>
<br>
Many folks wonder how it came to pass that on many Christmas trees <br>
the little angel has replaced the star on the top of the tree. This <br>
story will give you a new insight to the root cause of this change. <br>
Many years ago Santa was at the very end of his rope. He was just a <br>
few weeks away from Christmas and he was way behind in all of his <br>
preparations. One morning he woke up later than usual and realized <br>
that he failed to set his alarm clock. He looked over and found Mrs. <br>
Claus still sleeping beside him. Santa shook his dear wife and asked <br>
her why she wasn't up fixing his breakfast. She replied" Hey fatso, <br>
I'm sleeping in today!"<br>
Santa got out of bed and went to the closet for one of his Santa <br>
suits and found there was none hanging in his closet. Mrs. Claus <br>
told him to dig one out of the dirty close hamper and just make do. <br>
Santa stumbled down the stairs and into the kitchen, where he burned <br>
his toast and scalded his tongue of his hot chocolate. Just as he <br>
was cooling his mouth down one of his elves burst into the kitchen <br>
screaming," The Reindeer broke out of their pen!" Santa immediately <br>
ran out of the backdoor and slipped and fell into a huge pile of <br>
reindeer poo mixed with mud. After rounding up the reindeer Santa <br>
went back up stairs for a shower, but to his dismay there was no hot <br>
water. After his cold shower he put on the next cleanest Santa suit <br>
and headed off to the workshop. Upon entering the workshop he found <br>
all of his elves sitting around munching on cookies and drinking hot <br>
chocolate. He was so upset he couldn't speak, when finally one elf <br>
came up to him and told Santa that they had formed a union, he was <br>
the union steward, and they were on one of their many coffee breaks. <br>
It was just about this time when the little angel came into the <br>
workshop dragging a tree and asked," Santa, where do you want me to <br>
put this?"<br>
<br>
<br>
Merry Christmas<br>
