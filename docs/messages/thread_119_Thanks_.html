I am super excited because I just pulled off a carving project that I thought wouldn't work until I was much more experienced. I LOVE the way my carve came out, and I'm super excited to plant this series. Now I just need to come up with a pirate series name. Hmmm. Suggestions? :-D<br/>
Anyhow, thanks again for all the help, and it was so much fun meeting and hanging with everyone at the BBQ.<br/>
