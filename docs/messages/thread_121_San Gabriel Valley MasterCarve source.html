MasterCarve!!!  Apparently you bought up the only Mastercarve in <br/>
SoCal, so I'm hoping for some marvelous new stamps! I can't say <br/>
anything, since Sir B. gave me some Mastercarve at the SLO, and I <br/>
haven't done a thing with it, but I do have some nascent stamp ideas. <br/>
As far as local LBs go, I am first stamp in the "Blue Boy" letterbox, <br/>
planted on December 31st--hey, it's my own neighborhood--I'd be <br/>
embarrassed not to be 1st Stamp!  Leslie also placed a couple of LBs <br/>
in the Magic Kingdom ('bout time); you're welcome to them if you can <br/>
afford the $100-plus dollars it would take to get your clan in.  <br/>
Happy New Year to you, G-String, Moody Cat, Watermelon, and Jellybean!<br/>
