<br/>
I guess this isn't very helpful to those of you up in northern LA County but I figured that since we were on the topic of where to get MasterCarve, I would let everyone know about this source.<br/>
<br/>
As for the MK boxes, I would love to try and find them but knowing the throughness of the cleaning peeps there, I don't hold much hope for them lasting.  I am also hesitant because we are at Orange Alert in the U.S. and Disneyland is on the list of known terrorist targets (remember the guy they caught crossing from Canada into Washinton with the carful of explosives just before the Millenium?  One of his targets was Disneyland.)<br/>
<br/>
I keep picturing myself pulling the box out from behind Mary Todd and being thrown to the floor with an M-16 at my head...  : )<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, there is a [plug your ears, Don] geocache that has been in the Magic Kingdom since Sept. of 2002.  The last time it was found was yesterday so it is still in place.  The container is really ingenious.  It is a gutted toy cell phone held in place with magnets.  If anyone accidently sees you retrieve it, all you have to do is put it to your ear and pretend like you are talking!!<br/>
<br/>
I think California Adventure is a place that would be perfect for some letterboxes.  Low traffic, lots of little corners that no one goes to (i.e. most of the park).<br/>

  MasterCarve!!!  Apparently you bought up the only Mastercarve in <br/>
  SoCal, so I'm hoping for some marvelous new stamps! I can't say <br/>
  anything, since Sir B. gave me some Mastercarve at the SLO, and I <br/>
  haven't done a thing with it, but I do have some nascent stamp ideas. <br/>
  As far as local LBs go, I am first stamp in the "Blue Boy" letterbox, <br/>
  planted on December 31st--hey, it's my own neighborhood--I'd be <br/>
  embarrassed not to be 1st Stamp!  Leslie also placed a couple of LBs <br/>
  in the Magic Kingdom ('bout time); you're welcome to them if you can <br/>
  afford the $100-plus dollars it would take to get your clan in.  <br/>
  Happy New Year to you, G-String, Moody Cat, Watermelon, and Jellybean!<br/>
