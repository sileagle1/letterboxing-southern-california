books were damp. All snails were removed and the container was <br/>
cleaned up a bit. I sure carved the wrong image for this letterbox <br/>
it should have been Mr. Snail with sunglasses. It should be back in <br/>
place by tonight 1/9/04. It had over 40 entries in the 2 log books, <br/>
some have been washed out, but most are readable. Both log books are <br/>
in the letterbox.<br/>
