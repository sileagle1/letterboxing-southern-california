  We're heading down to San Diego this weekend to visit Sea World.  We<br>
  hope to visit the Batiquitos box on the way.  Buzzard, does it need<br>
  anything? Maybe we'll run into Clan Jiggs :-)<br>

<br>
Is this the Los Penasquitos Canyon Waterfall Letterbox?  I saw the<br>
listing on the new site.  Just taking a quick glance, the clues look<br>
the same as the ones on the old site.  You've recommended it a few<br>
times. It sounds nice.  I passed it up because of the "4 miles round<br>
trip".  It could end up being too long for the little ones and we'd<br>
end up carrying them back :-)  I haven't been in the area, so its hard<br>
for me to judge.  I'm sure they've walked that far at Disneyland, but<br>
on the other hand we went with a church group on a 4 or 5 mile R/T<br>
hike up around Chantry Flats and that hike was too long.  I think<br>
we'll save it for later, unless serendipity puts us in the area.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the info,<br>

Spacey Holly,<br>
There are a few steep hills to trudge for the Batiquitos Lagoon box, <br>
but it's really a short hike; you guys will be fine.  I was just down <br>
in Carlsbad the week after Christmas to visit my parents, and <br>
suggested to my brother (who lives there) that we go visit the box, <br>
since this was my first trip since I adopted it.  But my visit was <br>
right after the SoCal Christmas Day rainstorm, and he was right to <br>
say the trail would be a mire, so I skipped checking on it.  From all <br>
reports, I believe this letterbox to still be in place, and you'll <br>
get a nice view of the ocean.<br>
