Buzzard, I tried to recreate your method of a magnatized altoid box,<br/>
but the fridge -type magnet doesn't cut it.  Thanks for the help!<br/>

You might try http://www.sciplus.com/ -- they have some rare earth magnets <br/>
(like the Mighty Micro Magnet) that are much stronger and smaller than <br/>
other magnets, as well as a 15-ft long, 7/16" wide magnetic strip that's <br/>
easily cut (see the item called "Hang in There") and just $2.95. Search on <br/>
"magnets" to find what's available.<br/>
<br/>
One warning, though -- this site and its catalog can be dangerously addictive!<br/>

You have to glue two to four magnets on a round Altoids can. They are made by Master Magnets,Inc. part #07001. www.magnetsource.com <br/>

The sheet magnets, which I get from Michael's, are fantastic if they <br/>
are affixed to a smooth metal letterbox, like an Altoids tin, and <br/>
placed on a very smooth metal surface, like a metal sign, or <br/>
underneath metal stairs. But this material is weak in other contexts. <br/>
There's a famous letterbox in San Luis Obispo that uses this magnetic <br/>
material on the round surface of a plastic 35 MM film canister which <br/>
is then stuck underneath a metal shelf, and the hold is not very <br/>
strong at all (though this particular box, in a very protected <br/>
environment, has lasted since 12/29/02). I copied the use of <br/>
refrigerator magnets from a California Bear letterbox.<br/>
