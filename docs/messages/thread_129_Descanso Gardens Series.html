                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have received a few e-mails recently about the log books filling up in the Descanso boxes.  I went out this weekend and added a second log book to each of the boxes and updated the clues for the #3 Nature Trail box to reflect the bench being moved.  I was just in time for box #1 as the lasty page was used on 1/6.  I also cleaned some water out of the boxes and replaced all the bags as they all seemed to have been punctured.<br/>
<br/>
When I opened one of the boxes, I found a live pill bug (aka rolly polly bug) in it.  I am guessing it got in the day before when the previous visitors were at the box.  That is one lucky bug!  If I hadn't come out the next day, the next visitors may have found a dead pill bug inside.  :)<br/>
