                    <div class="plaintext-content">Batiquitos Lagoon was a great place to visit.  The kids didn't even<br/>
notice the hills and had a great time reading the log book.  The Gecko<br/>
stickers were also much appreciated :-)  Many geocachers had written<br/>
in the log book, so I checked the geocaching website and the box is<br/>
listed there too!  <br/>
<br/>
For general information, it was a great weekend to visit Sea World, we<br/>
were the only RV in the parking lot.  We ended up dry camping at<br/>
Silver Strand SB on the spit south of Coronado.  Since they don't take<br/>
reservations, there wasn't a problem getting a parking spot, even<br/>
though all the other state beaches along the coast were booked.  The<br/>
only draw back is that they lock the gate at 7 pm and don't open it<br/>
until 8 am. <br/>

Happy Hunting,<br/>
