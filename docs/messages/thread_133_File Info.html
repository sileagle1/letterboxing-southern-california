I think Doug had to retype? to get the text to look right. When I uploaded the file it looked very similar to the file Ca. Bear uploaded and when I tried to print it out from the file it wouldn't print out and remain on the page correctly. It might be the way it was set up on our page and it might be easier to copy/paste from Doug's page? "Tivo" isn't that kinda like kickboxing?<br/>

I didn't retype it exactly -- I'm a master at global search &amp; replace <br/>
functions so I was able to whip the formatting into shape in no time!<br/>
