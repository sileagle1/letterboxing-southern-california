                    <div class="plaintext-content">White Water is rated 1 through 6. 1 is flat and 6 is unrunnable. Class 3 is generally rapids with standing waves that doesn't require very much maneuvering. You do not swim if you come out of a boat, you rely on your life jacket(PFD) and the techniques I will go over in a safety talk. I do not paddle guide on tough stretches of white water any longer, so you can use that as a guide. In other words I will not do paddle guiding where there is a big chance of the guide going out of the boat, due to one of the paddlers screwing up. I still row class 5 , but rowing puts the two oars in my hands. This section of the Kern is generally considered a novice run and would be the section of river that some one would use if they were just learning to guide a boat. I hope this helps answer your questions. You might find more info on line or you can write us directly or via chat list. Actually the chat list may be better as it could answer questions that others are thinking about.<br/>
