                    <div class="plaintext-content">We confirmed that both of these letterboxes are missing. We replaced the Shore Bird and moved it to a new location. It seems as though popularity got the best of both boxes. There was a worn path off trail for a couple of feet to the Shore Bird that probably alerted maintenance folks and we had directions to Wendy's Pelican in our box. The new location shouldn't bother any one. It is a unique box as it is the first store bought stamp we have ever planted. It was all we had with us.<br>
