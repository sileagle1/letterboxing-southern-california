#1<br/>
The Water Tower<br/>
<br/>
This is the highest point in our city, so if you are anywhere in town,<br/>
look up!  From the 110 freeway, northbound, exit at Fair Oaks Ave and<br/>
turn right at the light.  Travel south to the 5th stoplight.  This is<br/>
Monterey Road. Turn right and travel through 2 or 3 lights to Via Del<br/>
Rey.  Turn left here, and travel up the hill.  At the top, turn right<br/>
at La Portola Street (no stop sign or light).  Drive up until you see<br/>
the tower.  Park, and walk around the gate to the top of the driveway.<br/>
 You will find yourself directly above someone's house, so be<br/>
considerateand quiet!!! <br/>
<br/>
Stop and look around!  This is my favorite spot, especially in<br/>
February, when the smog is blown away, and the trees are still a bit<br/>
bare.  At this time of year you can pick out a lot of landmarks.  Look<br/>
east to find the Huntington-Ritz Hotel (we call it the "pink hotel")<br/>
Can you find Suicide Bridge?  How about the Pasadena city hall?  Can<br/>
you see the Oaklawn Bridge?  It can see you!!  Fall is also a lovely<br/>
time for this spot, as the foliage is turning.  Spring is good too,<br/>
for that matter, when the Jacaranda are in bloom!<br/>
<br/>
Follow the driveway to its end, and then turn round the corner to the<br/>
left at the cinderblock structure. Look ahead, and you will see a<br/>
telephone pole.  Walk to the pole.  Check your compass.  At 280, look<br/>
to find a wiry, multi-trunked cactus-like tree, 6 paces away.  The box<br/>
is under some rocks, in the center of its trunks.<br/>
