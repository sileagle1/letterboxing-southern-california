Thanks for your compliment. Did you notice if any other letterboxers had stamped in ? We have planted an additional 6 letterboxes for the Kernville Gathering that have not been posted, and the clue sheets will be handed out for these. We are not going to post the clues on the web site until after the event. Don't forget April 24 th. and bring your multi color set.<br/>

Yes, this stamp is pretty popular, there were 6 or 7 stamps ahead of <br/>
mine.  I think I was the only SoCal letterboxer to stamp in, at least <br/>
I didn't recognize any of the stamps. I will be in Kernville on April <br/>
24th, and am planning on staying overnight and attending the barbecue-<br/>
-please consider this my RSVP. I'll bring a box of my own to plant.<br/>

P.S. Tiburcio is not dead, stay tuned.<br/>
