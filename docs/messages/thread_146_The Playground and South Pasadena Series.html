I ran out yesterday to complete the South Pasadena Series, and the <br>
Playground Series.  Please tell Claire that her "The Rose" letterbox <br>
in Singer Park is my 100th find.  I found my first letterbox exactly <br>
1 year ago today--"The Eaton Canyon Letterbox"--found on 2/15/03.  <br>
This letterbox is still very much alive. Spacey Holley & Family beat <br>
me to your first three South Pas. boxes, but since you placed number <br>
four more recently, she missed that one, and it's the coolest one to <br>
find. I've heard of people planting these kind of letterboxes but had <br>
never seen one.  I need to get me an LB planted in my beloved <br>
Pasadena library before you do it. <br>
 <br>
I had hoped to spend today finishing the carving on my latest series <br>
(3 1/2 finished, 2 1/2 to go), but I just saw that you planted two <br>
more letterboxes in Pasadena's Las Flores Canyon. I'm heading out <br>
after these boxes in a few minutes, and hopefully they won't take me <br>
too long to snag (my wife is being extremely reasonable about this, <br>
but I don't know how long this will last if I keep disappearing on <br>
weekends to find your rapidly proliferating letterboxes).  I'm glad <br>
to see you are heeding the letterbox clue-writing standards and <br>
informing people of possible hazards they may encounter while <br>
searching for your boxes, though I've never before seen a warning to <br>
beware of mythological beasts (or are they?!).<br>

Claire is going to look at your stamp in her "rose" box tomorrow, and then plant another in her series.  She is very excited!<br>
