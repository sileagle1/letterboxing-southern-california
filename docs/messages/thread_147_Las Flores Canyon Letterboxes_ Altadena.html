Leslie's description of the trail. When Leslie says to "Wear good <br/>

a lone hiker myself, this bad patch of the trail gave me pause, but <br/>
I'm unnaturally stubborn by nature, so I pushed onward. Considering <br/>
the 150 foot drop next to this part of the trail, having a hiking <br/>
buddy would've only made it easier for the police to recover the <br/>
body. Most of the rest of the trail is less scarey than this part <br/>
(now pay close attention to what I just said), and is really cool. <br/>
For the letterbox, it ends at two large, strange, concrete structures <br/>
deep in the wilderness, with a series of rusted metal pipes coming <br/>
out of them. One of these concrete "bunkers" made a great place to <br/>
sit and stamp in. More adventurous letterboxers will love this trek--<br/>
I like being out in the sticks.<br/>

  I visited the latest Leslie letterboxes today in Las Flores Canyon, <br/>
  and was 1st Stamp in both. "The Cobb Estate" LB terrain should be <br/>
  rated as very easy, and is good for small children. This is a very <br/>
  interesting romp around early 20th century (c. 1916) foundations, <br/>
  walls, and the remains of driveways and lightposts. On a clear day, <br/>
  the view is lovely. <br/>
<br/>
  The second stamp in this series, "Bigfoot Waterfall," is another <br/>
  matter. The hike to this letterbox is through a gorgeous canyon, and <br/>
  I met no one on the trail either coming or going. But I want to <br/>
  emphasize to other LBers that they need to pay close attention to <br/>
