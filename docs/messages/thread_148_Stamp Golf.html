I had big plans to go after Stamp Golf this last Saturday, but I <br/>
decided at the last minute that my car needed a little work, and I <br/>
didn't want to risk driving all the way to Long Beach. I instead <br/>
opted to hunt for some great local Leslie boxes. Once you replace #3, <br/>
I'll try to get out ASAP and beat California Bear to the first <br/>
complete Stamp Golf stamp.<br/>

Well we aren't positive # 3 is missing as the distance was measured in Varas and I had a dickens of a time in finding that one to use. FYI I just posted some more info on the Kernville Gathering listing the 6 letterboxes created for the event. I'm not sure if all letterboxers in SoCal receive the chat lists so I created a page to list the event in the list of letterboxes in the area. Probably the best info page is located on Silent Doug's site www.letterboxing.info/links/ , and you can also cruise through his "gifts for letterboxers". I was the hero this V day when I gave Gwen a "Get a Clue-Go Letterboxing" hooded sweatshirt. He has a bunch of stuff for sale. Hopefully you are planning on doing the HH I mentioned previously. Also you should make sure that you complete the Kernville Dragon when you come up, and maybe keep an additional copy of the clues and stamp images at work.<br/>

I can't say for sure if #3 is missing but I can say that the California Bear clan spent 35 minutes poking in every tree in the vicinity a few months ago and came up with nada.<br/>
<br/>
I just bought a 200' tape measure for another hobby (benchmark hunting) so I will have to head out there with tape measure to take a look.  That should be nice and subtle.  No one will ever suspect I am up to anything as I string the tape out across the street.  ; )<br/>
