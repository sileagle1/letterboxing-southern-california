I am curious as to what everyone uses for making their stamps. <br>
I did purchase some Master carve and since my carving is all that <br>
great would like to save it for some special stamps.<br>
As soon as this heat lets up will try to get out and plant some boxes.<br>

<br>
I carved a stamp today and will be planting it this weekend around Julian.<br>
I am going to try to carve another stamp tomorrow also for planting this<br>
weekend.  We'll see how it goes.<br>

have purchased all of them in my area so now we are trying out the less<br>
impressive, non-jumbo erasers. We use these cheep (2 stamps for 99 cents in<br>
the jumbo, 8 in the smaller) ones both for cost and because they contain no<br>
latex, unlike most other materials I've seen mentioned. Since I have bad<br>
reactions to latex and I do all the carving (far too much risk letting 7 and<br>
8yos handle knives), I factored in the stamping mediums materials in ways<br>
others probably don't need to worry about.<br>

<br>
I have tried lots of materials but MasterCarve is the best as far as <br>
ease of carving, definition, and durability. <br>
<br>
The stuff was designed by a stamper who was later seriously injured <br>
in a car crash. She sold the material's formula to MasterCarve who <br>
kept the motto "Carves like butter" on the package. Hope that this <br>
helpled her pay her hospital bills. Kate at Stamp Luis Obispo told me <br>
about that.<br>
<br>
Stamp Luis is now carrying the thinner MasterCarve, which works just <br>
fine for box stamps. I like the thicker stuff for my personal stamps. <br>
I think I paid $9 for two 4"X4" squares.<br>
<br>
Now, what do all of us use for carving tools?<br>
<br>
I use the Speedball set and a 0.5mm Two Cherries gouge for details. I <br>
think it has improved my otherwise poor carving. I also have a set of <br>
Dockyard gouges that I am slowly coming to appreciate. I bought them <br>
and the Two Cherries at Mountain Heritage Crafters' website.<br>
<br>
Hope to see lots of you at the Oct 4th event,<br>
Sir B<br>
