had a lot of fun putting it together, you'll see:-)  Inspired! <br/>
Probably a once-in-a-lifetime thing, though.<br/>
<br/>
Lots to see at the arboretum right now.  A movie set is going up on<br/>
the lawn and they're repainting the cottage.  The Lake has water! <br/>
More movie magic?  Tomorrow (Saturday) is Arbor Day and big tents were<br/>
going up today, should be fun.  Free Tuesday is coming up...take<br/>
advantage.<br/>

Spacy Holly,<br/>
Now you know I had to try and beat Leslie to this box, so I couldn't <br/>
wait until "free Tuesday." What a great box, stamp, and stamp book. <br/>
You have a gift for finding great hiding places, and I was extremely <br/>
careful about not giving this hiding spot away to passerby. It's <br/>
great to see the lake filled again with water. This visit to the <br/>
arboretum was my first chance to confirm that my letterbox planted <br/>
near the waterfall is indeed missing, and I'll replace that one after <br/>
I plant my latest series, which is a lot of work, since the series <br/>
ranges all over Los Angeles. <br/>
