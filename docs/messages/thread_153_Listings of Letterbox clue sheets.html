                    <div class="plaintext-content">We received a "Contact the Placer" note from some one that was <br>
researching info on Millard Falls and she wanted to know more about <br>
letterboxing.I sent her an attachment linking LBNA site and also <br>
gave her a thumbnail description of letterboxing. I became curious <br>
regarding the listing so I searched Millard Falls, Jack Creek Falls, <br>
Fossil Falls,Seal Beach and a couple of of other locations. When <br>
ever the title of our letterbox matched a location of the same name <br>
our letterbox clue page was listed. I knew that when ever a <br>
letterboxer had their own web page I could find some of them by <br>
doing a search, but I did not know individual clue pages from the <br>
LBNA list of clues would be found there too. I always assumed that <br>
when NPS located a letterbox on park areas it was because they had <br>
cruised through the LBNA web site, but my guess is that they just <br>
check internet search engines. If you have a problem with having <br>
your letterbox clues available outside of the LBNA clue listing then <br>
be advised that you should not use the location name as the title of <br>
the letterbox. If you currently have a letterbox on the grounds of a <br>
location that may not want a letterbox on it's property and it is <br>
named after the location sooner or later it will get you a "C" count.<br>
