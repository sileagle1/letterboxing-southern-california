it went most of our email addresses , thus we didn't have Buzzard's address.<br>
I figured that most of the folks on the SoCal list would enjoy reading this<br>
post anyway. Don't worry SoCal they didn't hit every letterbox, the high<br>
country is still closed for snow. Gwen & I are in Seal Beach and have dried<br>
out "Beach Grandma's" letterbox and tried to replace #3 Stamp Golf, but<br>
without a compass we couldn't figure out where in the heck we first hid it.<br>
We should be able to find it tomorrow . Things would have been easier if<br>
only I hadn't tossed the first measurements, the ones we used before we<br>
converted them to the listed ones. I'm sure that every one that have pursued<br>
this letterbox is getting a big chuckle right about now.<br>
