post anyway. Don't worry SoCal they didn't hit every letterbox, the high<br/>
country is still closed for snow. Gwen &amp; I are in Seal Beach and have dried<br/>
out "Beach Grandma's" letterbox and tried to replace #3 Stamp Golf, but<br/>
without a compass we couldn't figure out where in the heck we first hid it.<br/>
We should be able to find it tomorrow . Things would have been easier if<br/>
only I hadn't tossed the first measurements, the ones we used before we<br/>
converted them to the listed ones. I'm sure that every one that have pursued<br/>
this letterbox is getting a big chuckle right about now.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Don and Gwen,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many thanks for making our visit to California so<br/>
&gt; enjoyable.  Those Kernville boxes kept us so<br/>
&gt; delightfully busy; that I (Pete) had a tough time<br/>
&gt; keeping awake in the evening despite your charming<br/>
&gt; hospitality and wonderful stories!  After the<br/>
&gt; goodbyes, we visited the River Statistic and went back<br/>
&gt; to the cemetery and got Old Kernville for Wanda who<br/>
&gt; just couldn't handle another hill the previous<br/>
&gt; evening.  Then we drove over the pass to visit Coyote<br/>
&gt; Hole 1 &amp; 2 and Red Rock Canyon, all in good shape. We<br/>
&gt; also found the Sliding Along hitchhiker. Glad it was a<br/>
&gt; "rubber" snake rather than a real one!  We just missed<br/>
&gt; Robbers Roost; the park ranger closed the gate just as<br/>
&gt; we arrived at 5:30.  Spent Monday in the Pasadena area<br/>
&gt; where Leslie and Buzzard kept us busy all day.  Never<br/>
&gt; made it down to Long Beach nor up the hill to Millard<br/>
&gt; so I guess we'll have to plan another trip!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You have done a really great job preparing for the<br/>
&gt; gathering.  Had no trouble with the box clues at all;<br/>
&gt; just wish we could be there next month.  We shall have<br/>
&gt; to put out a report to the main talk list to help<br/>
&gt; build interest and let folks know there's lots to do<br/>
&gt; in Kernville.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Take care,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wanda &amp; Pete<br/>
&gt; in snowy RI<br/>
&gt;<br/>
