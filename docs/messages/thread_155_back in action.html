We are a busy scout family, and we just ended the annual cookie sales.<br/>
 The cookies are good, and the money supports our cities troops for<br/>
the rest of the year, but DANG! its a lot of work.  (By the way, I<br/>
still have cookies if anyone wants...$4 bucks a box.)<br/>

All I could do was watch as Buzzard beat me to the arboretum.<br/>

Glad to have you back in the fray.  I took off after your new South <br/>
Pasadena additions yesterday (before Spacey beat me; not that this is <br/>
a contest ;-)).  It took me a bit to find the Las Flores Adobe--that <br/>
house is well hidden.  I asked the help of a local who lived not 100 <br/>
feet from it and he had no idea what I was talking about!  I found <br/>
the first two letterboxes, but believe the LB located behind the <br/>
South Pasadena Historical Museum may be missing already.  I expect a <br/>
lot of people find opening the doors to this oven-like structure <br/>
irresistible.  Thanks for the fun!<br/>

I just edited my clue friday night, after our sad discovery.  We took the<br/>
gold line to memorial park (Claire calls it the park of the freaks!), and<br/>
while waiting for the train, Emma took it upon herself to check the status<br/>
of the watertrough box.  Boy!  Were we dissapointed!  That makes a positive<br/>
3 boxes I have lost.  1 in disneyland, 1 at the library (the bonus video)<br/>
and now this.  I can barely stand it.  But now I get to make a new, better<br/>
stamp!<br/>
Hey... do you know anything about the kernville event (other than what is<br/>
posted?)<br/>
and also, have you been to the HOLLYWOOD sign, and found that box? Just<br/>
wondering!<br/>

There is a lot of info posted on Silent Dougs web site about the Kernville event, but if you have some questions let us know.<br/>

&gt;That makes a positive 3 boxes I have lost.  1 in disneyland, 1 at <br/>
the library (the bonus video)<br/>
&gt; and now this.  I can barely stand it.  <br/>
<br/>
So sorry to hear about the missing library box.  I loved finding <br/>
that bonus video; I might be the only person who got to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hey... do you know anything about the kernville event (other than <br/>
&gt;what is posted?)<br/>
<br/>
I've had a couple of private emails from Don &amp; Gwen, but I basically <br/>
just know what's been posted. I'm definitely going to be there, and <br/>
have gotten permission from Annette at the Gnosis 4-H Club to bring, <br/>
as an Event Stamp, their "Mormon Road" letterbox, which I recovered <br/>
from its fire ravaged location outside of Lake Arrowhead (I need to <br/>
let D&amp;G know about this; I guess I just did).  This letterbox's <br/>
plastic container is melted, the baggies are fused, and the stamp <br/>
book is singed, but the stamp and book are intact.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and also, have you been to the HOLLYWOOD sign, and found that box? <br/>
&gt;Just wondering!<br/>
<br/>
I was 1st Stamp in Mandrill's Mt. Lee letterbox last May, but <br/>
haven't been back, so I don't know if he has replaced it yet or not. <br/>
You should Email him.  This is a really neat hike in the Hollywood <br/>
Hills, but Mandrill doesn't mention that it's verrry long; not too <br/>
long for you and Ranger, but too long for Claire.  I believe I was <br/>
also 1st to stamp into Mandrill's Mt. Hollywood box--I did both <br/>
mountain climbs the same day.  If you haven't yet been, this is also <br/>
a great hike, and you can look for the "Two Cats and a Troll" LB in <br/>
Griffith Park while you're there.  Be forwarned, there's almost no <br/>
shade on either of these mountains.  Have you been to my "Leap Year" <br/>
box in Victory Park yet?  This is where I walk my little ill-<br/>
tempered pit-bull mix (generally at night when there aren't any <br/>
small children around, or as my dog considers them--prey)?  Claire <br/>
will enjoy the new playground equipment they've recently installed.<br/>

You already asked and Mormons are very welcome . If any one wants more info on Kernville that is not answered by the posted info just let us know. The one thing that is not listed is" How long would it take to nab every letterbox in our area?" Well Pete and Wanda couldn't do them all in two long days. We have 7+ planted just for the event and if you check the clue page for our area you will realize the need for plenty of room in your personal log books. If you could take an extra day then you would have a better opportunity to get more out of this gathering.  Bethany just asked us about the access for the rafting letterbox for non rafters, and all of our boxes can be reached by hiking/walking.<br/>

not.  Thanks!<br/>
