Did you ever manage to get over to find this box? If not and you <br>
still want to try I'd still like to meet with you. Maybe we can get a <br>

I have not yet found this stamp, and it's probably the closest one <br>
to my house that I have yet to claim.  I'd love to meet up out there <br>
with you and any other letterboxers for a stamp exchange and a hunt <br>
for this box.  If memory serves, Doughnut, G-String, Moody Cat, <br>
Watermelon, and Jellybean have already found this stamp (though <br>
we've never done an exchange), but I don't know about Spacy Holly, <br>
California Bear, Jam n Jelly, or Leslie.  Any weekend morning, <br>
including this coming one, is usually good for me.  Thanks!<br>
