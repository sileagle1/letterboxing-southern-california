<br>
I'll be heading out this week to see what I can salvage.<br>
<br>
In related news, I just noticed that the other Hitchiking Ghost box that I planted last year is not on the LBNA site.  I thought I entered it into the site but it's not there!  Either the site had a server hickup or I had a brain hickup (more likely).  In any event, I will also need to go out to 1) make sure it is OK and 2) get the directions again so I can post them to the site.<br>
