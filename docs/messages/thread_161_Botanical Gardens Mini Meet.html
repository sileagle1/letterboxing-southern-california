It sounds like this weekend is too short notice for our mini-meet, <br/>
since Spacy Holly has plans and Leslie is working in the morning (a <br/>
gig?).  Afternoons don't work well with me (though if everyone else <br/>
could only meet late, I'd come too). (It sounds like California Bear <br/>
won't be available for several weeks, but for selfish reasons that <br/>
wouldn't necessarily deter me from a mini-meet sooner than that, <br/>
since I've already had the privilege of obtaining his [beautifully <br/>
carved] personal stamp.)  What does everyone think about next <br/>
Saturday or Sunday?<br/>
