Sorry to hear that you have two missing. I recently cruised through Google search engine because we had received a note from someone doing research on Millard Falls and they had come across our listing for our Millard Falls letterbox and wanted more information about letterboxing. Since that time we have received about 5 more notes on other letterboxes that folks had stumbled onto while surfing the net. When I went to Google I was blown away as several of our letterboxes had first listing and others were 2nd or 3rd. I believe that any time a location is used in the letterbox title there is a more likely chance that some one might stumble onto it. I think this is probably how the NPS finds some of the letterboxes on NPS property. I did a google search on both of your letterboxes and since you had pulled the clues all that came up was the waver at the bottom of the clue page. While this may not be news to computer techs, obviously some of us that are just newbies to these magical machines are a little concerned about having listings on our letterboxes and concerned that it puts any letterbox at more risk than just being discovered by accident in the field. Jay Drew is probably lurking in the SoCal bushes as is Ryan and they may have a word or three about this subject as I see a potential problem in too much info. In any case sorry about your letterboxes.<br>
Don <br>

  Well, I'm sad to report that both the Briggs point and Grandpa's 75th <br>
  in San Dimas are MIA. I kind of thought the Grandpa's 75th would <br>
  disappear because of the location, but Briggs point was in a pretty <br>
  hidden place and had a lot of other trash around it. The trash is <br>
  still there but the box is gone. I've removed both from the LBNA list.<br>

Lurk?!  You call me a lurker?!  *rolling eyes*  =)<br>
<br>
If I don't post often to this board, it's only because I don't do <br>
much letterboxing in southern California.  (However, I did hide a <br>
box at Point Mugu this afternoon, so look for clues coming soon!)<br>
<br>
Speaking of southern California letterboxing, the Mugu Peak <br>
Letterbox is alive and well, happily resting next to a snake that <br>
seems to have made it's home under a rock a few feet away.  (Don't <br>
worry, it's not poisonous.)<br>
<br>
But back to the subject at hand....  For those of you that write <br>
your own webpages and link LbNA to your website, you can tell Google <br>
(and other search engines) not to include your page in searches by <br>
including this line in between the HEAD tags in the HTML:<br>
<br>
<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" /><br>
<br>
If you use LbNA for your actual clues, though, you're at the mercy <br>
of the Google bots.  You might try e-mailing Wes and begging and <br>
pleading to add that line for all clue pages on the site <br>
automatically.  It won't work if you do it yourself since the site <br>
will automatically strip tags from clues for security reasons. <br>
Carpe diem!<br>
