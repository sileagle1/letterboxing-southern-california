<br/>
I had a chance to do some letterboxing this weekend around San Diego.<br/>
<br/>
The two La Jolla boxes, La Jolla and Tea Time were alive and well. <br/>
Both had pretty views of the ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Los Penasquitos Canyon Waterfall Box was alive and well. We picked up<br/>
the Arizona Vacation Hitchiker there.  A geocacher had also visited,<br/>
so bring some stash if you go visit.  I didn't have anything suitable<br/>
on me to trade :-)<br/>
<br/>
We tried to find The Painted Rocks letterbox (only listed in the<br/>
basement), but couldn't come up with it.  It's been abandoned for<br/>
awhile  and very overgrown.  We didn't get itchy, but I swear some of<br/>
the bushes looked like poison oak.  We gave it a good shot, Don!<br/>
<br/>
Webb Park, near Painted Rocks was alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Don, we didn't make it to your Jack Creek Falls box - next time!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>
Spacy Holly<br/>
