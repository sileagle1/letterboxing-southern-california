&gt; If you use LbNA for your actual clues, though, you're at the mercy <br/>
&gt; of the Google bots.  You might try e-mailing Wes and begging and <br/>
&gt; pleading to add that line for all clue pages on the site <br/>
&gt; automatically.  It won't work if you do it yourself since the site <br/>
&gt; will automatically strip tags from clues for security reasons. <br/>

I can talk to Wes about it the next time I see him online and try to <br/>
talk him into taking steps to avoid clues being listed on search <br/>
engines.  But keep in mind, if you have a webpage, there is <br/>
absolutely NOTHING to prevent people from linking to it--including <br/>
search engines.  The major search engines (such as Yahoo or Google) <br/>
will honor requests for pages not to be listed, but there's nothing <br/>
one can do to prevent it from happening if they really want to go <br/>
ahead with it.<br/>
<br/>
Search engines generally find pages from other pages that link to <br/>
them.  If you want to avoid having them from finding your page, <br/>
don't provide link to your clues in the first place.  They can't <br/>
index it if they can't find it!  =)<br/>
<br/>
But I can talk to Wes and see what he thinks.  He's the brains <br/>
behind the outfit, sorta speak, and nothing happens without his <br/>
involvement.  :)  All powerful, all knowing, Wes.<br/>
