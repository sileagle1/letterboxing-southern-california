Wendy had one that may be MIA.<br/>
Our son pulled his, and you would have to go by Kayak to reach it in any case. There was another, but I'm pretty sure it was pulled  or went missing too.<br/>

I believe "The Island Fox," which TurtleMcQ directed you to, has <br/>
been pulled, and is now an Event Stamp.  If you check your stamp <br/>
book, you might find it among your "SLO Stamping In The Meadow" <br/>
Event Stamps--that's where I got it, and I believe the placer said <br/>
at that time they wouldn't be putting it back out in Catalina.  Too <br/>
bad, because I'm heading out to Catalina in a couple of weeks (hint, <br/>
hint).<br/>

If it is island letterboxes you seek, maybe you should try another island since you already figured out the clues.<br/>

Yep, and I hope to get in some letterboxing before (and after) check-<br/>
in time at Falling Waters.  If it was up to me, I'd be on the road <br/>
