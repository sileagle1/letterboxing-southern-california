  Yep, and I hope to get in some letterboxing before (and after) check-<br>
  in time at Falling Waters.  If it was up to me, I'd be on the road <br>
  bright and early, but I may have a few chores to do in the morning <br>
  before setting out.<br>

Don & Gwen,<br>
Thanks for the letterbox tips; I'll have to hit most of these on the <br>
way back, because I'm bringing every Kernville and Wofford Heights <br>
letterbox clue I could find, and that's a lot of work. I'd be honored <br>
to have dinner with you folks on Friday night, and I'll ask for <br>
the "Old Boy" at Falling Waters (he's not going to punch me for <br>
calling him that, is he?). I already carved a Falling Waters stamp.  <br>
The stamp won't pass muster with you or Old Boy, but maybe no one <br>
else will notice the flaws. Ryan tells me to always behave like the <br>
stamp came out exactly as planned. <br>

There is a possibility for a magnetic box? at the Falling Waters sign ? There is no hand carved stamp that can not pass muster and Chuck would really love it. Make sure you read our last update about high country road closures. Did you carve the HH stamp I mentioned?<br>

I remember you mentioning an HH, but I can't for the life of me <br>
remember what it was. I've checked back, but still couldn't find it. <br>
What was the HH?<br>
