You didn't tell us when they are leaving. Right after the Kernville gig is over we are heading to 4 corners area and will be taking highway 40. We will be leaving some in our path, but may not get a chance to post until we return.  Amanda has a box in Needles"Snoopy's Brother Spike" but that is the only one I know of along 40.<br/>
