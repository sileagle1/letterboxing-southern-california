<br/>
I apologize if anyone has tried to get ahold of me since 4/9.  I had an incident while upgrading to XP and lost all my e-mail since then.  I also had some driver problems with my network card so was off the net for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Add in a trip to Washington DC and short illness and I have been out of commission for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
On a positive note, I did manage to get one letterbox in DC, Orion the Hunter.  I also managed to do that without getting arrested!!!  (A real trick in DC these days.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all have fun in Kernville tomorrow.  Again, real life is getting in the way of letterboxing, so I will not be able to attend.<br/>
