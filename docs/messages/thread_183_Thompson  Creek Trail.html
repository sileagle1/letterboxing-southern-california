Well, we didn't get to Kernville, but we did try to find a LB today. <br/>
Alas, It was not there.  I am wondering if anyone else has recently<br/>
found this box in Claremont?  I think the tree in question is now a<br/>
burnt stump.  I sifted around the ashes, but no box. California<br/>
Bear...is this yours now?<br/>

 I'm pretty sure this letterbox is toast(literally). I've posted all of the gathering clues except one so if you get up this way there is a bunch of letterboxes you can go for. Sorry you couldn't make it.<br/>

Thanks for the heads up!<br/>

Hi Leslie,<br/>
Just after the fires someone reported this box burned, so I went out <br/>
to search since I knew where it should be. My Grandson and i searched <br/>
around and found only the baggie the stamp was in. It had an <br/>
impression of the stamp on the inside. So don't know if the firemen <br/>
took it or not. It's too bad because it was a really beautiful stamp.<br/>
