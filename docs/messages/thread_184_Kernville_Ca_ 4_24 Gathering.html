                    <div class="plaintext-content">Before we head to Sedona for a bit of R and R we want to give a big <br>
thanks to all the folks who came from cities far away to play in the <br>
Kern River Valley.   We both enjoyed meeting and visiting with you <br>
all.  We got to see what a Buzzard really looks like, and to see a <br>
real Sierra Sally and to meet Lee and Nancy who had traveled to <br>
Kernville before to get some of our boxes.  Amanda and Ryan were <br>
doing a tour of Southern California over the weekend yet had time to <br>
visit us and plant a box  (we got it on Sunday afternoon, Thanks!).  <br>
The Jiggs clan had river front lodgings and was a delightful bunch <br>
and newbies Patti and Earl who are part timers in Kernville, found <br>
some surprises in the old town. We realize that our valley is not an <br>
easy place to get to so we appreciate the effort that it took <br>
everyone to visit us.  Hopefully you will come back for a longer <br>
stay and to pick up those boxes that time did not permit getting on <br>
the weekendand find new plants.  We were glad that so many folks <br>
wanted to raft and that you were able to put aside boxing for a <br>
while to play on the water.    Thanks for making the weekend so <br>
successful, thanks for your contributions and most of all thanks for <br>
your fellowship. <br>
 We will be off list until May 12th. <br>
Don & Gwen  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now that I've been to Kernville and know what it's like, I'll <br>
definitely agree to putting it into the Southern California group.  <br>
Geeze, it's hot there!  *rolling eyes*  =)<br>
<br>
Of course, Anaheim wasn't much better.  Disneyland and California <br>
Adventure were fun, but the 101 degree weather wasn't.  I spent much <br>
of yesterday afternoon an any air-conditioned building I could find.<br>
<br>
But I digress....  Thanks Don and Gwen for planning such a terrific <br>
event!  Amanda's already talking about rafting trips she wants to do <br>
all summer.  *rolling eyes*  I fear I may have lost my hiking <br>
companion.  =(  I'm sure it'll all work out, though.  =)<br>

Farewell!<br>
