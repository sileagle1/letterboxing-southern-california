The cost is $55 for the first dog. Reservations are a must as specific times are set up. Contact SGVQU at 866 206 9070 extension 6715 or email sgvqu@onebox.com for additional info or reservations. Training will be at Sierra Madre dog park. This is set up to keep hunting dogs protected, but is open to all breeds.<br/>
