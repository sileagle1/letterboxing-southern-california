                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just checked the first 2 letterboxes, and added the third log to box #1 as the second log was nearly full. These letterboxes have had a lot of folks stamp in over the last 3 years. I still find it interesting that box # 2 can clearly be seen in it's spot from quite a distance and yet hidden when you get close.<br>
