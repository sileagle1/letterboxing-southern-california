I just returned from a visit with my daughter Campfire Lady in <br/>
Battleground WA. Boy, what a beautiful place to box. Since we had a <br/>
mini-meet I managed to get 17 boxes 1 event stamp-1 HH and 21 <br/>
exchanges. It was a busy weekend and I was totally exhausted when I <br/>
got on the plane to return home. These LBers are a wonderful bunch of <br/>
people and so enthusiastic. It was really fun. Purple Iris.<br/>
