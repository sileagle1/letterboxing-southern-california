<br/>
Since I'm fuzzy on the line that seperates the State thought I'd <br/>
post this on both. Sorry to those who belong to both. <br/>
<br/>
Just a report on some boxes on the Central Coast. Added 15 boxes to<br/>
my log book, placed 2, set the Monarch Butterfly HH free and dropped<br/>
off the Sunnyside HH.<br/>
<br/>
The following boxes are alive and well:<br/>
Ocean O<br/>
Shady Coyote (Added a plastic bag to the book)<br/>
The Rock and The Heron<br/>
Gull in the Sky<br/>
Harry Potter Series 3 boxes - All 3 need new books<br/>
Pines by the Sea (Was first finder this is an AWESOME spot &amp; stamp)<br/>
Driftwood by the Sea<br/>
Night Train<br/>
SLO Halloween (my first Buzzard box)swapped the bag as it had a hole<br/>
Palm d' Or<br/>
The Bookstore<br/>
A-Z series "S" stamp<br/>
<br/>
Also stumbled into StampLuis and happened to get another non posted<br/>
box there.<br/>
<br/>
The Stinky Cheese box is missing, but I did dig up a skull of some<br/>
sort of animal.<br/>
<br/>
Planted two more Mission boxes at San Luis Obispo and San Miguel.<br/>
I'll post clues in the next couple of hours<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everybody for the great boxes!<br/>

Thanks for baggin' the buzzard box.  This LB was planted the day <br/>
after the Stamping in the Meadow Gathering in SLO--that great event <br/>
put on by Sir Balthazar, Jugglermouse, and Ash Raven.  Did you happen <br/>
to spot Susie in the bookstore?<br/>

You know, it was rather funny, but I went to the bookstore yesterday <br/>
and checked up on the boxes there.  Imagine when I had seen that <br/>
Sierra Sally had logged THAT VERY DAY!!!  I asked Susie and Emily <br/>
that work there if they caught any 'suspicious characters' lurking <br/>
around the photography section, and did remember one person who had <br/>
asked about it, but wasn't sure if that was her or not.  (They like <br/>
to try 'catching' people finding letterboxes in the store, though <br/>
they do have a terrible record.)<br/>
<br/>
I wondered around downtown a bit after that checking where <br/>
letterboxes were to see if I could track down Sierra Sally, but <br/>
alas, it was not meant to be.  I warned Suzie and Emily to keep a <br/>
lookout for her, though, since she was known to be wandering the <br/>
area that afternoon and she didn't get the other letterbox in the <br/>
bookstore.  (Can't say which one that is--it's a mystery box, <br/>
though!)  I kind of doubted she'd come back for the second box being <br/>
a mystery box and all, but who knows?<br/>
<br/>
In other news, while I was browsing the books myself, Sir B happened <br/>
to wander in which was a nice surprise.  I hadn't seen him since the <br/>
Stamping in Meadow event.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Turns out, yesterday was probably the biggest 'gathering' of <br/>
letterboxers in SLO since that event--without even trying!  Okay, <br/>
maybe Suzie and Sir B aren't technically 'letterboxers' anymore, but <br/>
still.....<br/>

I forgot to ask about Susie in the bookstore, but I found the box <br/>
without asking directions I was BLENDING IN best I could. Guess it <br/>
worked.<br/>
<br/>
I was all over SLO Saturday, sorry I missed you. I would have liked <br/>
to meet Sir B too. SLO is like Letterbox heaven next to Kernville! <br/>
My next trip is to Pasadena (Buzzard Country). I'm scoping out my <br/>
plan of attack now. <br/>
<br/>
I was probably over at the Mission dodging weddings (4 of 'em) and  <br/>
waiting for the Cal Poly event to end so I could figure out your <br/>
Walking Tour and so I could hide my Mission Box.  After it took me <br/>
like FOREVER to decode just the first section, I decided there <br/>
wasn't enough hours in that day to finish. So I went to the second <br/>
location and got the info to decode the second part and decided I'd <br/>
have to come back and finish that box at a later date. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the Spell check Don. I had it right and changed it Dang! <br/>
Don and Gwen, the Penni's Lincoln box is street parking, so don't <br/>
know if the trailer will make it or not. Depends on the time of day. <br/>
There's pretty good parking on 6th St just one block North.<br/>
<br/>
Keep boxin' y'all<br/>

Hello Good People,<br/>
<br/>
Had the good fortune of going to the sunshiny central coast this <br/>
weekend. Here's the latest on some boxes<br/>
<br/>
St. Patricks Flyers - found box one on 12/11 but couldn't find box 2 <br/>
due to darkness. Went back this weekend, saw 25,000 butterflies, but <br/>
still could not find box 2. (several trees fell during the Dec <br/>
storms)<br/>
<br/>
Flutter - alive and well.. beautiful stamp and location<br/>
<br/>
Day and Night Mouse - Alive and well, awesome stamp<br/>
<br/>
My own box .. Money from the Sea was washed out to sea with the Dec <br/>
storms apparently. Will replace it in the spring<br/>
<br/>
Placed a New Box - Elephant Seals just north of San Simeon.. 600 <br/>
pups so far what a sight! Will post clues soon<br/>
<br/>
San Miguel Mission - The clues are all wrong .. (Sorry folks) Will <br/>
fix them ASAP<br/>
<br/>
Mission Soledad - Alive but soggy.. replaced the book today.<br/>
<br/>
That's it.<br/>
Happy Boxing all<br/>
