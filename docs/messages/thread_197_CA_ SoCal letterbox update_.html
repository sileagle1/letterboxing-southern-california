Thanks for the nice compliment. The two you left in Kernville were pretty cool. I kept thinking "Sports Coach" not stagecoach(DUH!!!!) and was totally blown away by your cool carving. Dos Locos of SLO had beaten us to them as they found them on 5/8. They didn't try for some of the gathering stamps though. We did a maintenance check on the Whiskey Flat trail and Bull Run Creek boxes. You will kick yourself, get ready,when I tell you that you passed within 100 feet of the #1 Bull Run Creek box on your way to and from the Buzzards Perch LB. It is very close to where you had to cross the creek. Oh well there is always something for next time and that is why we put out more for the gathering than you could hit.<br>
