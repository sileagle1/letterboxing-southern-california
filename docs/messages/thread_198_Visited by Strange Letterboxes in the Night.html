                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, that's a complete fabrication.  I was actually visited in the <br/>
daytime by Ryan (SLO) and Amanda from Seattle on their way to <br/>
Laughlin.  What a cute couple!  This was my first exchange with other <br/>
letterboxers so I'm pretty excited about it all.<br/>
<br/>
I had inadvertantly advised them that the Party Hearty! letterboxes <br/>
was already MIA, but it turned out NOT TO BE SO! I had hid it so well <br/>
even I couldn't spot it at first. So, have at it folks.  If it <br/>
survived the weekend it will very likely be there for you!<br/>
