They spent a weekend in early May sucking up all of the Kernville gathering leftovers. They even beat us to Buzzards two plants! You should have come a few weeks earlier. We picked up Tom's Bday HH from their visit, thanks. I'm not sure that they did the Sign Bite or Retriever though.              <br/>

 Here is a letterboxing story about the Forest Service and NPS. The trail of 100 giants has been closed due to tree limbs hanging dangerously from trees. Our government officials decided to close the area(not the rest of the forest where tree limbs hang all the time)to protect us. Several agencies and concerned public met in the parking lot to study the problem. Mad Dawg(yes there really is a person by that name[see Kernville LBs] ) was  interested  and invited himself to the meeting. Upon meeting the various officials in the parking lot, one of them was holding a rather odd cylinder covered with brown duct tape. This government guy was asking some folks around him if they had ever seen anything like it. Mad Dawg walked up and said he thought he knew what it was and took the article and put it in his car. The Leprechaun Among the Giants letterbox saved for another replant sometime in the future. I'm not sure how it came to be found as the hiding spot was pretty good, but suffice to say we will find a better spot.<br/>

<br/>
This is Ceci from Dos Locos.  To bad we missed you. <br/>
It would have been nice to run into a fellow<br/>
letterboxer.   My boyfriend Josh and I had the<br/>
opportunity to go up to Kernville since my parents<br/>
live in Bakersfield and it's close enough to come and<br/>
go in one day.  Unfortunatly, we only went for one day<br/>
and didn't get all the boxes there But we will be back<br/>
again sometime this summer.  I wish i would have<br/>
looked up events sooner and we would have gone to the<br/>
Kernville gathering.  Oh well, we'll go to an event<br/>
someday. <br/>
<br/>
