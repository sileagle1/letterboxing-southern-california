I did meet a Mother and her two daughters yesterday while at the <br>
Botanical gardens. She said she was new the national list, but I <br>
didn't get and e-mail. They were Doughnut,Watermelon and Moody Cat. <br>
That was exciting because it was my first exchange. Purple <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Cool!  So far, I haven't made any trail exchanges.  I did have a pre-planned<br>
exchange with Don and Gwen recently.  They have planted 106 boxes so far and<br>
are still going strong!  Some of them are no longer in existence but a lot<br>
of them are.<br>
<br>
I am currently working on their Seal Beach walking tour.  I started it<br>
Monday after work and have only picked up three of the six boxes so far but<br>
I do have all of the clues deciphered.  Yikes!  If I never have to read<br>
another historical plaque, I won't be upset!  ; )<br>
