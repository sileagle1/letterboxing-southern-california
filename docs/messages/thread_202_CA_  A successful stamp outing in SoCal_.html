another letterbox in my Other Canyons Series in Eaton Canyon, but I <br/>

<br/>
The "#2 stamp of the Strange Stamp Series" by Jam n Jelly.  I finally <br/>
got back to this stamp, which was missing the first time I went for <br/>
the series.  All three stamps are still in place.<br/>
<br/>
The "Easter Bunny Letterbox." My first ever Amanda stamp!  This LB <br/>
was also missing the first time I attempted it, but Amanda has since <br/>
re-planted and moved it to a new nearby location.  As Amanda <br/>
mentioned in a post, the logbook was full, so I brought along another <br/>
logbook to leave in the box.<br/>
<br/>
"Warm Fuzzy," planted by AsianMary.  Double-Saj and Old Blue were the <br/>
first stamps here 3 days before me.  I didn't know they were in town.<br/>
<br/>
"The Hunt for the Borg Cube," planted by moderndulcinea.  Interesting <br/>
hike into the fire-charred hills above Claremont.<br/>
<br/>
"The Morbid Tour: The Jack Letterbox," planted by Q.  This letterbox <br/>
is actually located in South Pasadena, not Los Angeles.  This is an <br/>
easy grab for a fantastic stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Even with all the new additions, I'm starting to run outta <br/>
letterboxes down here.  So I'm starting to make plans to revisit San <br/>
Luis Obispo and Kernville and have a letterbox orgy.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As you know you only scratched the surface here in Kernville, but it is starting to get dang hot so I would think the coast would be preferable. Although the high country letterboxes would be a whole lot cooler than the in town ones. You could always head toward Seal Beach and finish the Tour. We just received a post that the Real 49er at LB State is missing, but only 1 in 5 letterboxers have hit that one, so it is a good guess that it is still there. I've noticed that there are a few new letterboxers in the LA area, so who knows maybe somebody will be planting more. You might want to set up a mini meet and have a "group" find for the Stamp Golf. When we set it up we were thinking that it would be a real hoot to look for the pieces with a bunch of other letterboxers . Particularly if everyone had different compass readings and each trying to figure out cubits, fathoms and old Russian feet. You would have to adhere to the rules though and if you finished early enough a Joe's Special, pickled egg and a Schooner at Joe Jost's would be a great way to finish the day.<br/>

That is exactly how I finished my trip to the Signal Hill Letterbox, <br/>
including the pickled egg, and some fresh roasted peanuts.<br/>
