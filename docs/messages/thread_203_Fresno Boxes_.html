somehow my yahoo account was "bouncing" you away...oh well...<br>
<br>
We had a great camping holiday in the sierra's, and took the<br>
opportunity to try to find a couple of Sierra Sally's boxes.  We<br>
enjoyed finding the Dala Horse  (what a cute town!)  and tried to get<br>
the Fresno Water Tower, but it was closed for Memorial Day.  The rest<br>
of the Fresno Cultural Trail will have to wait until our next trip,<br>
but seeing as Grandpa lives in Fresno, it shouldn't be too long!  My<br>
husband, who grew up in the area, was familiar with all the box<br>
locations.<br>
<br>
We camped about 1 1/2 hours east of Fresno, at Mammoth Pool.  The area<br>
is pristine.  As beautiful as Yosemite, with no people!  We climbed<br>
giant boulders, following Chiquito Creek without a trail for 3 hours<br>
like little mountain goats, until we reached the lake. ( Emma, Claire<br>
and I thought Buzzard would like it) It was closed to boating due to<br>
migrating deer (alas, no swimming deer to be seen)  so the place was<br>
empty!  We swam, and hiked, and swam and hiked...it was great.   And<br>
we managed to avoid all of the thousands of poison oak plants!<br>
(leaves of three, let them be!)  If you are in a camping mood, I urge<br>
you to check out this great spot!!<br>
