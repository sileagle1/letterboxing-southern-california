I made mention that it may still be there as only 1 in 5 letterboxers have been able to find this one. Thanks to Kristin as she just sent a note advising that it indeed was still in place. Kristin must be in the top 20%.<br/>

Hmmm.  Not I have to rethink my idea of where this might be.  I don't think the artsy crowd would be concerend one way or other about the spot I had in mind.  Perhaps I am starting from the wrong side of the blue pyramid.<br/>
