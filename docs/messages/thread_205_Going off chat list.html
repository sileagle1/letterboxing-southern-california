Before we left we just had to place another letterbox "Kern River Valley Veterans Memorial". Originally we thought that we would place the letterbox in Tank Park located in Lake Isabella as it has a newly dedicated monument for WWII vets, and remnants of the "Arizona", but we couldn't find a suitable hiding spot close by, so we chose this other location.<br/>
