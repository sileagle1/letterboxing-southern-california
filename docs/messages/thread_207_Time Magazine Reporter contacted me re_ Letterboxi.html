I spoke with Sean today and he seems like a nice guy. <br/>
As one of the best letterboxers in So Cal you should<br/>
talk to him, to bad Don &amp; Gwen are not around to meet<br/>
with him. I would like to get thier view on this. I<br/>
think that Ryan has talked to him.<br/>
Take care,<br/>

I actually mentioned that to him myself.  If there was a president <br/>
and first lady of letterboxing in southern California, it would be <br/>
them.  But noooo.....  They have to go jetting off to Sweden of all <br/>
places.  *shaking head*<br/>

Hope Don is taking lots of pictures of the Swedish Bikini Team.  =)<br/>
