I spoke with Sean today and he seems like a nice guy. <br>
As one of the best letterboxers in So Cal you should<br>
talk to him, to bad Don & Gwen are not around to meet<br>
with him. I would like to get thier view on this. I<br>
think that Ryan has talked to him.<br>
Take care,<br>

I actually mentioned that to him myself.  If there was a president <br>
and first lady of letterboxing in southern California, it would be <br>
them.  But noooo.....  They have to go jetting off to Sweden of all <br>
places.  *shaking head*<br>
<br>
Hope Don is taking lots of pictures of the Swedish Bikini Team.  =)<br>
