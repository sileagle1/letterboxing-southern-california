Best of the West Series #1: Johnny West<br>
Placed by: realroadrunner   (contact the placer)<br>
Placement date: Jun 13 2004<br>
State: Nevada<br>
County: Clark <br>
Nearest city: Blue Diamond<br>
Number of boxes: 1<br>
<br>
Clues<br>
Terrain: Trail through a cottonwood, oak and ash forest adjacaent to <br>
a desert wash<br>
Difficulty: Easy, mostly level trail, some slight inclines...there is <br>
a wheelchair accessible trail available, but the box requires going <br>
off trail. The loop trail is only .8 miles.<br>
Clues: Moderate<br>
Status: Awaiting first finder as of 6/13/04<br>
<br>
Favorite toys from the childhood of many of my contemporaries were <br>
the action figures and animals from the Marx Johnny West and Best of <br>
the West series.<br>
<br>
These 12" figures included our hero, Johnny, Jane his wife...daughter <br>
Josie (and later Janice)...his boy Elroy (no wait, that was somebody <br>
else)...his boys Jay and Jamie...bad man Sam Cobra, and noble Native <br>
Americans Geronimo, Chief Cherokee, and later Fighting Eagle and <br>
Princess Wildflower. Later came Custer and the Calvary, a couple of <br>
Sheriffs, and a variety of UK, Canadian and Mexican versions. These <br>
figures exhibited full articulation and molded on clothes, and came <br>
with a host of vinyl and poly-plastic accessories. The series ran <br>
from 1965 to 1975. Somehow my parents neglected to buy these for me <br>
at the time, but like a good boomer, I am happily acquiring them now.<br>
<br>
This series of stamps (five so far) celebrates these figures and <br>
takes them down off the collector's shelf and puts them back into the <br>
Western landscape they love. Yee-haw!<br>
<br>
Our story begins with our hero, Johnny West, waiting for the arrival <br>
of his beloved wife, Jane, from the porch of the Circle X Ranch (most <br>
city folk call the spread the Spring Mountain Ranch, but what do they <br>
know?) Johnny looks out across his fields and fences and sighs with a <br>
heavy heart. Jane was expected weeks ago, and there's been no word of <br>
her since she left Arizona. When he thinks of all the misfortunes <br>
that could have befallen her: a desperate desert death, thieves and <br>
banditos, or worse, she might actually have run off with that <br>
cheating, no good...nah...not my Jane...well those big cowboy tears <br>
start welling up in his painted on eyes.<br>
<br>
Johnny took off behind the main house towards his "thinking place," a <br>
beautiful secluded point looking over the wash behind the ranch where <br>
the Spring Mountains tower towards the heavens and a man...even a <br>
little plastic man, can sort out his feelings and be the kind of fool <br>
that HAS A LOVER'S GRIT.<br>
<br>
He was on the path now, his feelings not entirely accessible, rather <br>
kind of loopy to be exact. About halfway down the trail, he stopped <br>
to regard a four-trunked tree on his left right before the junction <br>
of two paths and a bridge. He stopped and thought, "Y'know, this is <br>
just one of those things, I'll betcha," said Johnny, "she musta hit a <br>
snag somewhere's and what's in a snag, anyway? Nuthin." He knew he <br>
was on the right path with his thinking now.<br>
<br>
He turned to go off trail towards his thinking place, oh, some of you <br>
might say at bearing of about 224 degrees, and marched off into the <br>
brush 55 paces until he came across that old metal thresher and the <br>
logs he always meant to do something with, like maybe make himself a <br>
chainsaw bear and put it on the porch, who can say? <br>
<br>
He was close now, just 15 paces from another four-trunked tree at a <br>
bearing of 160 degrees, where the vista across the Ranch opened up <br>
like a little kiddies' storybook. Such a bee-yoo-ti-ful sight he <br>
almost forgot he was supposed to be miserable in missing the missus. <br>
<br>
Johnny is waiting for you to join him! Reach inside the base of this <br>
four-trunked tree after removing a covering stone and another round <br>
rock. Please rehide as found.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Watch out for critters, the slithering kind of all types abound <br>
in this desert riparian environment. See, I can read signs. You <br>
should too. :-) <br>
Before you set out, please read the waiver of responsibility and <br>
disclaimer.  <br>

Difficulty:<br>
Clues-Moderate<br>
Trail-Moderate (3 on a scale of 1 to 5)<br>
<br>
The Desert Song Letter Box can be found in a state park about an<br>
hour's drive north-east of "The Meadow." Drive to the north-east<br>
from that meadow on the interstate highway. After about 30 miles take<br>
the exit to the right on a highway whose digits sum to 16. Head east<br>
along that highway for 15 miles to the park entrance where you will be<br>
required to pay a modest entrance fee. The sites of the park are well<br>
worth the cost. Pick up a park brochure there. Continue onward for<br>
another 3 miles marveling at the wonders on either side of the road.<br>
You'll pass an area of bee hives where you won't find honey and trees<br>
that won't burn. Take a left turn toward the visitors' center, but<br>
don't go there. Rather proceed uphill through extra-terrestrial<br>
looking terrain. You'll pass the turn-out for the water tank of a<br>
rodent and continue onward until you arrive at the end of the road.<br>
Park in the lot there, then read and heed the signs and advisories<br>
near the public conveniences.<br>
<br>
Your quest continues on foot along the marked hiking trail.<br>
<br>
The trail should be no trouble for experienced hikers, but it is more<br>
difficult than a walk in a city park. There are boulders to climb over<br>
and gullies to walk up. There will be tricky footing in places. Make<br>
sure that you are prepared for a two hour round trip hike in the<br>
desert. The desert temperatures can be higher than 100 degrees F in<br>
the summer. Make sure to take sufficient water and to use sun block.<br>
Take precautions against the heat. Read and heed the warnings and<br>
advisories on the park brochures and the trail head signs. The desert<br>
environment is fragile. Please take care not to disturb vegetation.<br>
Watch out for the animal inhabitants. Some of them can be<br>
disagreeable. Take a compass and know how to use it. Exercise proper<br>
precautions to avoid getting lost.<br>
<br>
Continue your search on the marked 1.2 mile hiking loop that leaves<br>
the parking lot. You'll start out traveling down a gully and then past<br>
a structure erected as a prop for the 1965 movie "The Professionals."<br>
The area has been used in the filming of many movie scenes. See if you<br>
recognize parts of it from any of your favorite movies (not "Gone with<br>
the Wind" though). Continue on the hiking trail to a narrow corridor<br>
between two high rock faces. Follow the trail through the corridor<br>
enjoying the cool relief from the dessert heat.<br>
<br>
Upon exiting the corridor the hiking path turns to the right, but<br>
don't follow it. Rather leave the hiking path and proceed due west<br>
along a drainage gully also known as a wash. The wash will take you to<br>
another corridor between two rock faces about six feet high. At the<br>
exit of that corridor turn left heading due south and continue<br>
following the wash keeping near the rock face on your left.<br>
<br>
After a short distance, the main drainage path will turn to the<br>
right; don't follow it. Continue in a southerly direction parallel<br>
with the rock face on your left. While following that left hand rock<br>
face, you'll soon be able to observe your next landmark. That will be<br>
a very large rock shaped like the head of an eagle with beak pointing<br>
to the left and perched on a very high peak ahead at a bearing of 165<br>
degrees. Continue toward that noble bird.<br>
<br>
When you get near the base of the eagle's lookout the wash will pass<br>
to its left. Stay in that wash still keeping the same rock face on<br>
your left and now the eagle's head on your right. You'll be traveling<br>
up a gully on a bearing of 130 degrees. The footing becomes more<br>
difficult in this area, so be extra careful.<br>
<br>
The gully will take you to a drop-off looking down upon a large flat<br>
sandy area. Stop on that overlook, your prize is near. Turn to your<br>
left looking in a north-east direction. You'll see the end of the high<br>
rock face that has been on your left and a low hill continuing forward<br>
like a shoulder from the base of that wall. Climb onto that shoulder<br>
being careful not to fall off, and proceed to the junction of the<br>
shoulder and the sheer rock face above it. If you look around the end<br>
of that face, you'll see the road that brought you to the parking lot;<br>
but don't go in that direction. Your prize is already within you<br>
grasp.<br>
<br>
Notice the overhang formed at the bottom of the high rock face. A very<br>
short distance back from the end of the face you'll see a pile of<br>
rocks that have fallen from that overhang. Your Desert Song is<br>
crooning sweetly within. After stamping in, make sure to replace it<br>
carefully protected and covered by those rocks so that other visitors<br>
may also enjoy its sweet notes.<br>
<br>
With a careful eye on your compass reverse your course to return to<br>
the hiking trail from which you deviated earlier. You can retrace your<br>
steps all the way back to the parking lot or continue around the<br>
remaining hiking loop to get there. The distances are roughly the same<br>
in either direction.<br>
<br>
The park has some truly amazing works of nature and of man. If you<br>
have the time you would be well advised to enjoy them while the notes<br>
of your Desert Song still ring in your ears.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your visit. This letterbox will be checked very<br>
infrequently. An email report on its condition would be very much<br>
appreciated.<br>
