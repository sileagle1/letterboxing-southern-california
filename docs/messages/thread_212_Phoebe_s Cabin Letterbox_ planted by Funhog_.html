                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I discovered that the legendary Funhog had planted a letterbox <br>
in Newbury Park, only a one-hour drive north of Pasadena, I was off <br>
to find it the next Saturday.  Since the LB had only been planted a <br>
couple of weeks earlier, and since it involved a 5 mile hike, which I <br>
thought would scare off some letterboxers, I even had high hopes of <br>
being the "First Stamp" in a Funhog Box!  <br>
<br>
The hike was beautiful.  I'd heard about this area before, because <br>
Ryan has planted a couple of letterboxes in this range, and I'd <br>
always planned to take a trip up here to find these.  I found <br>
Funhog's letterbox, and was the first actual stamp; however, <br>
unfortunately, I was preceded by geocachers.  The geocachers found <br>
the letterbox on 5/27/04, took the stamp as a trade item, and <br>
replaced it with a little toy.  I saw from the stamp book image that <br>
the Phoebe's Cabin stamp was beautiful too (heavy sigh).<br>
<br>
These geocachers signed their names, and I wondered if anyone can <br>
tell me the best way to try and contact them.  I took the toy they <br>
left in Phoebe's Cabin and would be happy to exchange it with them <br>
for the Funhog stamp, which I'd then replace in the letterbox.  I've <br>
gone to the main Geocaching site, but haven't figured out yet how to <br>
contact a geocacher through it.  Can anyone tell me the best way to <br>
contact geocachers?  <br>
<br>
P.S. I left a Hitchhiker in Phoebe's Cabin, so at least the next <br>
finder will get a stamp after that hike.<br>
