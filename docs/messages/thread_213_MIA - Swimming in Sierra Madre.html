<br/>
I visited my Swimming in Sierra Madre box after swimming lessons today<br/>
and it's gone.  Bummer.  It's a nice park, so I'll try to replace it,<br/>
but I have to find a better hiding place!<br/>
<br/>
I'll remove the clues for now, sorry if anyone was disappointed.<br/>

That just sucks the big wah-ta-ka!  I was first stamp in that stamp <br/>
book on Thanksgiving Day, 2003 (okay, so I spent Thanksgiving with my <br/>
family like everyone else, but I managed to slip away for a little <br/>
letterboxing).  Sorry Spacey, but this appears to be the way of many <br/>
a letterbox.  As examples, I have before me the re-carved stamps of <br/>
three of my "Halloween Series" LBs, and one stamp from my "Other <br/>
Canyon Series." It's time for me to do some letterbox-house clean-up. <br/>
