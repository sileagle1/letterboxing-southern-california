his first official letterbox hike.  We were able to find 7 of the <br>
eight positronic signatures and put together Commander back <br>
together.  Being printmakers, we actually ended up making a couple <br>
extra images on other paper since the stamps were so nice...<br>
<br>
We were the first finders in all the boxes, and hope who follows will <br>
get our sense of humor...our butts and legs are still sore from the <br>
climb!  A workout, but well worth it!<br>
