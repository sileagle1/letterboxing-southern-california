We be back in the country and while Gwen headed up to Kernville I stayed in Seal Beach thru this next weekend. We received a note that #2 Express in El Dorado was missing. I verified that the Easter egg hunters must have grabbed it for their basket. Elvis still lives as does the other El Dorado boxes. It seems as though"Time waits for no man" and I hope the writer was sufficiently schooled in the finer points of letterboxing, particularly those of secrecy, stealth and proper replacing of a letterbox. We have very mixed emotions about newspaper and magazine articles, certainly a love hate relationship. In the end it is probably best to cooperate and try to get good info into a writers hands, but I have never had much reason to trust the press as many do not seem to discharge their responsibilities well.<br/>
