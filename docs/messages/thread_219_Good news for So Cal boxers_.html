What a good idea, dummy boxes!!  Thanks for all the planting you've been doing :)  I know I've already printed out a few sets of clues.  I live in Northern Calif right now (poor me) but my family lives in Socal, and I'm coming for a vitit in a couple of weeks, and can't wait to box down there.  Hopefully I'll get to move back to Socal soon...I miss it.  Northern California is a whole different world :(<br/>

Sounds super I hope you are planning to leave a few in Italy. What <br/>
time period are you planning on? I'm not currently receiving any <br/>
list posts yet, but should be back to receiving when I get back to <br/>
the 'Ville.<br/>

I'm sure I'll have a good time once I am there but I tend more towards the great outdoors type of vacations and am not a huge art fan (which is on of the big things about Italy).  This is my wife's vacation.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am a photographer and I have heard that the architecture is fantastic so I am looking forward to taking lots of pics of that while I am there so I have that to look forward to.<br/>
<br/>
I kicked around the idea of making some letterboxes to plant in Italy but I don't relish the thought of being arrested in a foreign country after being mistaken for a terrorist if I am caught planting a box somewhere.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
In my post yesterday, I mentioned possibly planting another box this morning but alas, the container I was testing failed in two ways. I discovered that:<br/>
1) Spray paint doesn't adhere well to the type of plastic that is soft and flexible and tends to come off on your fingers as well being very sticky to touch.<br/>
2) You can't use hot glue to hold magnets to plastic in an environment that is hot and exposed to the sun.<br/>
<br/>
<sigh>  Back to the drawing board for that one. I'll see what I can come up with this weekend and try to get it planted on Monday.<br/>

<br/>
In this case, it works well because I have an annual pass and live about 20 minutes away so I can get over there quite often to check and see if they survive.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Thanks for all the planting you've been doing :)<br/>
<br/>
You are quite welcome!  I have spent a bit of time being a finder and am now confident enough with my carving skills to be a planter.  I also hope this will be an encouragement to others in the area who have been thinking about planting boxes.  I have noticed that it seems when someone starts planting in an area, it creates a boom in planting by other boxers nearby.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I live in Northern Calif right now (poor me) but my family lives in Socal, and I'm<br/>
&gt; coming for a vitit in a couple of weeks, and can't wait to box down there.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know when you will be in the area and maybe some of us can meet for an exchange!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hopefully I'll get to move back to Socal soon...I miss it.<br/>
<br/>
I bet!  Here's to your rapid return...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Northern California is a whole different world :(<br/>
<br/>
You can say that again!  What part of No. Cal. are you in?<br/>

As I mentioned in another post, I probably won't be planting any in Italy.  This is my wife's lifetime dream so if I do something to ruin it like getting arrested, she may just leave me to rot in jail in Italy.  We usually do boxing on 'my vacations' so I will let this one be her's and do what she wants this time.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; What time period are you planning on?<br/>
<br/>
We are planning on going the end of Oct./beginning of Nov.  We were planning on mid Oct. then noticed that was around Ramadan, a Muslim holy day and decided that may not be the best time to be an American in a foreign country so we pushed it back by two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
BTW:  I finally got around to getting the last of the Seal Beach series.  Thanks!  Now if only I had time to take up golf...<br/>

We have made contact with the Cassini space probe, located the Mars <br/>
Rover and apprehended the Dalek on the Tardis. All three stamps are <br/>
very cool. Excellent carving!<br/>
<br/>
It took some time to locate Cassini--the clues were quite accurate, but <br/>
we experienced umm, a compass malfunction, yeah, that's it, a compass <br/>
malfunction...we sort of drifted around the solar system for awhile <br/>
until the malfunction was corrected. Great hiding place with an <br/>
incredibly beautiful view from up there.<br/>
<br/>
Still chuckling about the Tardis--great location!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for lots of new letterboxing fun in our neck of the woods!<br/>

(elusive because, as the reluctant husband type, he'll never post to <br/>
the list or admit that he is actually a practitioner of letterboxing. <br/>
Nevertheless, when the game is afoot, he joins in the hunt and solves <br/>
some clues faster than I do! Now the next challenge: I carved a stamp <br/>
for him this evening, so we'll see if he'll use it.)<br/>

&gt; the list or admit that he is actually a practitioner of <br/>
letterboxing. <br/>
&gt; Nevertheless, when the game is afoot, he joins in the hunt and <br/>
solves <br/>
&gt; some clues faster than I do! Now the next challenge: I carved a <br/>
stamp <br/>
&gt; for him this evening, so we'll see if he'll use it.)<br/>

LOL sounds like my husband!  Maybe I should carve him a stamp...and <br/>
give him a name, lol.<br/>

  What part of No. Cal. are you in?<br/>
<br/>
I live just 5 min. south of SF in Daly City.  My brother's <br/>
girlfriend sounded excited when I told her about Lbing (she lives in <br/>
Socal) so I'm going to try to persuade them to get involved when I <br/>
come down to visit.  Maybe I'll try to take them with me on a find.  <br/>
Get her to do some planting down there.  We're from the southern OC <br/>
area, where I noticed that there aren't as many boxes.  <br/>

That doesn't always work.  I tried that one for my wife and about the only time shes goes boxing with me is when we are on vacation and stuck in the same car!<br/>
