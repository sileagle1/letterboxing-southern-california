I apologize for the use of "brutal" to describe Seal Beach Town Tour.<br/>
The clues are tough but we had a great time in beautiful Seal Beach. <br/>
We opted for ice cream at Cold Stone and enjoyed the park at the <br/>
beach. <br/>
Thanks for all your plants. Hope that the Golf Course series can <br/>
still be planted!<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think that description was pretty accurate.  It takes a LONG time to decipher<br/>
those clues.  Fortunately for me, I have to pass right by there on my way to and<br/>
from work so I was able to do the decrypting over the course of several days.<br/>
<br/>
I still have a couple of the boxes to retrieve from that series but they may<br/>
have to wait till next week.<br/>

were!  I'm sitting in place for 20 minutes, my eyes getting bleary, <br/>
everyone staring at me (fortunately, I don't care if people stare at <br/>
me), gettin' sunburned--but it was great fun.  Thanks Gwen &amp; Don!<br/>
