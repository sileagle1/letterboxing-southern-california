                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, as was detailed by me in an earlier post, I was disappointed in <br>
my search for the Phoebe's Cabin LB, though the hike was fantastic.  <br>
While in the city of Thousand Oaks, I was able to find the Sycamore <br>
Letterbox, and was there also rewarded by a hitchhiker--The June <br>
Balloon--apparently launched by Silent Doug, no less!  Silent Doug, <br>
check to make sure you have your car keys.  I loved the clues for the <br>
Sycamore letterbox, and it was a challenge to find. The stamp has <br>
broken in two, but it's still possible to ink the two halfs and hold <br>
them together to make the stamp image.  <br>
<br>
Two days later, I was the first stamp in Sierra Sally's "San Gabriel <br>
Archangel" letterbox (which is planted close to my home).  Here I <br>
left "Ralph the Hitchhiking Letterbox," which I found in Kernville, <br>
and which has travelled all over the U.S.  <br>
<br>
This weekend, I travelled to Newport Beach in search of a plethora of <br>
newly planted letterboxes, and an old one.  I found "Tiki" <br>
and "Cassini," both planted by California Bear.  Both are great <br>
stamps.  The Cassini stamp clues are particularly fun to decode; it <br>
took me a while, but in the end the clues were dead-on, and I was <br>
successful. <br>
<br>
While on this trip, I also found "Catch the Castaways Curlew." I <br>
stamped-in this letterbox one week after Amanda. Don & Gwen, if <br>
Amanda hasn't mentioned it yet, the tree over this letterbox has been <br>
cut down, and a stump is all that remains.  The letterbox, however, <br>
is still in place beside the stump.  <br>
<br>
Finally, I found "Three Birds of Kells."  What can I say, these are <br>
beautifully carved stamps of birds placed in a beautiful bird <br>
sanctuary--perfect.  I left a few of the Newport Beach area <br>
letterboxes to be found another day; preferably a hot summer day in <br>
Pasadena, when I want to escape to the cool coast.<br>

  Amanda had advised us of the new stump, but I forgot to update the clues. After we got back from our trip I had 4 full days of a shooting competition and was in a different time zone(literally).<br>

Thanks!  I was hoping the Cassini clues would work.  I was a bit afraid after I got the first e-mail saying that it couldn't be found.<br>

<br>
I agree.  Those stamps are very beautiful.  If you are looking for a reason to come down south and box (like we need a reason...), these stamps are it. They are very intricate and delicate.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, this long weekend will afford me an opportunity to head up to north L.A. County to do some boxing.  Looks like I could spend a couple of days in Pasadena and still not get all of those.<br>

My daughter and I spent the weekend in O.C. we picked<br>
up "Tiki" and the "Birds of Kells" all nice stamps!<br>
We are embarrassed to say we bombed on "Cassini", we<br>
don't know what we did wrong. I guess we aren't as<br>
smart as that Buzzard ; )<br>
We are going back soon and give it another try also<br>
the other new boxes. Thanks for the fun,<br>
Jam n' Jelly<br>
p.s. any additional clues to cassini or is that<br>
cheating lol.<br>

Yes, Cassini was a challenge, but worth the effort. This morning my <br>
husband (the elusive Dr. Moriarty) commented that he had seen images of <br>
Cassini on the news, and recognized it before the announcer identified <br>
it because, as he said with the pride of a successful letterbox hunter, <br>
"I've seen The Stamp". It is a remarkably detailed and accurate image.<br>
<br>
We also found TARDIS, (which is just TOO fun--don't miss it next time <br>
you're in the area), and Corona Del Mars, another great stamp, on <br>
Friday. The terrain on Mars is steeper than one would expect in a small <br>
city park--fair warning to others who, like me, thought this one would <br>
not be strenuous!<br>

Aha! We were there on Friday but could not locate it. I worried that it <br>
might have been removed during the habitat restoration going on there. <br>
But I was only guessing about what tree to look for, since I couldn't <br>
get close enough to the benches (due to the temporary fencing) to read <br>
the names and figure out which one lines up with the tree. Thanks for <br>
the update.<br>

Thanks to you and to California Bear for the compliments! Glad you both <br>
enjoyed the stamps.<br>
<br>
I planted a mystery box this past weekend in Los Angeles County while <br>
attending the Annual Summer Solstice Festival of the California <br>
Traditional Music Society.  Looking forward to hearing when someone <br>
figures it out.<br>
<br>
Also picked up Little West Wetlands yesterday. Fun stamp, beautiful <br>
view, and lo and behold, it's so close to my work, I found it during my <br>
lunch break!<br>
<br>
Dr. Moriarty's personal stamp made its debut appearance this evening at <br>
the new Huntington Beach Micro Box Lifeguard Station #2. (This is the <br>
tiniest letterbox I've seen yet!) He still insists he is not a <br>
letterboxer, even though he was the first find the box location. He let <br>
my son stamp the new Moriarty image into the logbook. He wouldn't sign <br>
his name, but when I was going to leave it unsigned, he handed me the <br>
pen and suggested that I sign for him. So I did. He's hooked. Stubborn, <br>
but hooked.<br>
<br>
Couldn't retrieve #1 "The Bench": someone was actually SITTING on the <br>
bench READING A BOOK! What was this person thinking! Benches are made <br>
for housing letterboxes, not for sitting! We hung around for a bit, but <br>
he wasn't budging, and we had to leave to go to pick up my older son, <br>
so we'll return later for boxes 1, 3 & 4.<br>

<br>
Thanks again!  I found a new way of making the images I use for my stamps.  I had been trying a technique of taking a computer image and adjusting the threshold setting in a graphics editing program to make it into a black and white image but that often gave unsatisfactory results.<br>
<br>
What I have started doing is opening the image in Paint Shop Pro, creating a new layer then tracing the image on the new layer.  When I am done tracing, I hide the layer the original image was on and voila!  I have a line drawing of the image just asking to be carved!  I also started using the laser/photocopy and acetone transfer.  I used to use the pencil transfer method but I kept smearing the image while I was carving and ended up having to guess where some of the lines were supposed to be.<br>
<br>
  Also picked up Little West Wetlands yesterday. Fun stamp, beautiful <br>
  view, and lo and behold, it's so close to my work, I found it during my <br>

<br>
That's actually kind of funny.  We must pass each other on the way to work!  I work live in Lakewood and work in Newport Beach.  You live down by Newport Beach and work in Long Beach!<br>
