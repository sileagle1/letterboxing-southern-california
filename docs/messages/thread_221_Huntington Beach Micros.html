<br/>
I read about the trouble Periwinkle had with someone parking on the bench over box #1.  Someone was also parked there this morning but got up and left when I sat down on the bench.  It seems that people don't like being 'crowded' on a 6' wide public bench.  I got what I wanted:  a letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
I drive past the Nude Surfer Statue where box #3 is every day and never realized that he was nude...and I mean like anatomically correct nude.  There is a reason he is facing AWAY from the street. YIKES!<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend going for these either really early in the morning or really late in the evening, possibly even after dark as two of them are in pretty busy areas.<br/>
<br/>
BTW:  I love Dr. Moriarity's stamp.  I had a good chuckle at that one.  It definately fits the name.<br/>

<br/>
LOL! I think I wouldn't be so bold. But perhaps if I get tired of <br/>
repeated trips to the bench I'll build up the nerve...<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Great, my 10-year old is going to love this one. Is this sort of thing <br/>
covered in our letterbox rating system? :)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW: I love Dr. Moriarity's stamp. I had a good chuckle at that <br/>
&gt; one. It definately fits the name.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Yes, it fits the name and the owner. The image was a caricature of the <br/>
Dr. drawn by one of his students this semester. Seemed just right for a <br/>
signature stamp.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That's actually kind of funny. We must pass each other on the way to <br/>
&gt; work! I work live in Lakewood and work in Newport Beach. You live <br/>
&gt; down by Newport Beach and work in Long Beach!<br/>
<br/>
Costa Mesa, actually. I'll wave to you as I'm driving up the 405. <br/>
(Unless, of course, you are traveling down PCH.)<br/>

<br/>
Oh well, no need to wave then.  I prefer PCH.  It takes about the same amound of time but there is more to look at then the bumper of the car in front of you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We picked up the other Huntington Beach Micros yesterday, and also Mr. <br/>
Tiki. A nice morning spent down by the beach PLUS a cute set of micro <br/>
stamps added to my book--can't ask for more than that!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the parking fee at the State Beach went up to $10.00, and there is <br/>
a separate $10.00 fee at the City beach (can't use the same state lot <br/>
parking ticket, we tried). But you can avoid the City lot by the surfer <br/>
statue by parking at the meters on the street. At the pier, we parked <br/>
in the lot just west of the pier that allows you to pay by the hour. I <br/>
think it was $1.50 per hour.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoyed the crafts fair at the pier. Tip for reaching the pier <br/>
letterbox when others are in the area (probably most of the time): <br/>
adult stands at sink to wash hands to block view of child ducking under <br/>
sink.<br/>
<br/>
Had an early lunch at the Taco surf. Again, it's handy to take a child <br/>
to view the Tikis so as to look less conspicuous when going for the <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Lee &amp; Nancy and California Bear!<br/>
