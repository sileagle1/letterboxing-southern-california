<br/>
I've managed to get another Grandchild excited about LBing and am <br/>
planning on taking them to the Gardens. The clues to this box say it <br/>
is missing, have you had a chance to replace it or is it still <br/>
missing? At an rate we will look for the other three that are there. <br/>
Thanx. Purple Iris<br/>

Unfortunately, I haven't gotten `round to replacing this particular <br/>
letterbox, though it was a favorite of mine.  I have re-carved the <br/>
Rialto Theater, Memorial Park Moon, and Charmed Witch LB stamps, but <br/>
haven't yet replaced them; hopefully that will happen this long <br/>
weekend.  I did replace my Coyote Canyon LB, which is part of <br/>
my "Other Canyons Series."  It takes a bit of a hike to find these <br/>
LBs, so they haven't been very popular, but they are my first planted <br/>
letterboxes, and I have a soft spot for them.  I'm also working on re-<br/>
carving my "Pasadena Humane Society" LB, which was very popular, but <br/>
I've failed twice due to bad carving.  SoCal letterboxing has <br/>
recently heated up, and I've been busy finding all the new stamps.<br/>
