I was very proud to get the "First Finder" certificate for "The Swan" <br>
letterbox this morning.  I applaud you for using a true cryptogram <br>
for your letterbox clues--it took me two solid hours to decipher it, <br>
and after that much effort, I was very gung-ho on being the first <br>
stamp.  I was questioned by security at the entrance to this <br>
location, but I had already thought up a plausible excuse, and was <br>
given a map of the area that made my quest all the easier (it was <br>
their only map, laminated, and I was told to return it upon <br>
leaving).  Thanks for another beautiful stamp in my book (along with <br>
the "Three Birds of Kells" stamps).<br>

I was a little worried that security might screen folks out. Glad you <br>
were able to get in! I love that area. My sister and I go every year. <br>
Imagine sitting out by the lake listening to live traditional music all <br>
afternoon on a sunny day in June--it's just wonderful.<br>
