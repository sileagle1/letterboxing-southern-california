until I realized the clue was in the letterbox name.  Once I figured<br/>
that out, I found the LB, and found that the park was really cool.<br/>

I think taking Horus to Paris would be great; are you sure you can <br/>
get it through customs? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to mention that I did find the replaced Water Trough, and am <br/>
the 1st stamp in it.  Very good hiding place.<br/>
