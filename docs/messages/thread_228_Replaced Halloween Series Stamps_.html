                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I replaced my Rialto Theater, Memorial Park Moon, and Charmed <br/>
Witch stamps, so I believe my 6-stamp Halloween Series is again <br/>
complete.  The Suicide Bridge stamp survived the film crew that <br/>
swarmed around it a couple of weeks ago; maybe they found it and left <br/>
a note, I'll have to check.  I just saw it was there by driving by.  <br/>
The beauty of this location is there is no stopping on the bridge, so <br/>
even though you can see it from your car if you happen to be looking <br/>
in the right direction, you can't stop to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
The Charmed Witch letterbox I replaced today features a completely <br/>
different carving (better, I think), and is hidden in a completely <br/>
different location, so by virtue of the mutable laws of letterboxing <br/>
I declare that it counts as a new stamp find for those that found the <br/>
original.<br/>
