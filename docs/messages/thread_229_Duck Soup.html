Wildlife Sanctuary, "What sort of image would one find on a 'Duck Soup' <br/>
stamp?" I laughed when we found it--it's perfect! Thanks California <br/>
Bear!<br/>
<br/>
I have driven by this area many times without realizing how extensive <br/>
it is.  We had the trails almost all to ourselves, which is refreshing <br/>
in the middle of O.C. Egrets, herons, avocets, and of course ducks were <br/>
plentiful in Ponds B &amp; C. Definitely include this letterbox in your <br/>
itinerary when you visit Orange County.<br/>
