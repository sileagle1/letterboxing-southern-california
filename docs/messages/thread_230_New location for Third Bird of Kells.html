Bay preserve, be sure to print out the new clues. Box #3 has been <br>
relocated. The rock it was hiding under has been compromised. The <br>
Gardener has been using the rock to prop up a hose to water the tree. I <br>
worried that the box would become saturated, or worse, that the <br>
Gardener might move the rock so as to water the other side of the tree.<br>

Same stamp, same logbook, just a slightly new location.<br>
