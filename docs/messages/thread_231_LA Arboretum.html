of the letterboxes alive and well. Buzzard your Succulent II box was <br/>
in the right place, but just sitting out there in the open. We <br/>
covered it with a rock and some leaves. <br/>
<br/>
Spacey Holly loved your Cottage box and the log book. Wonderful <br/>
hiding place and of course the LA Arboretum box is a fun find.<br/>
<br/>
They are filming around the lake and have painted the cottage a dark <br/>
brown. I couldn't believe it. It looks just terrible.Thank goodness <br/>
we had seen it when it was all red and white. Thanks for the <br/>
wonderful afternoon. Purple Iris<br/>
