                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks everyone, for your input.  The book is HUGE, and several people<br/>
off the list have already stamped in from across the country.  So, if<br/>
you would like to, I will have the box with me tonight at Garfield<br/>
park in South Pasadena.  The annual summer concert in the park series<br/>
is underway from 5-7pm. (SWING night tonight...I think) and I will be<br/>
at the Girl Scout Bake Sale Booth starting at 4:30.  Come by and say<br/>
"Hi", and stamp in.  And bring a buck to by a brownie.   This is the<br/>
same park as Claire's  "garfisaur" LB. <br/>
