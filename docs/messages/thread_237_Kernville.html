Only 105 degrees! Yawn. It hit 98 degrees in Pasadena today; we're <br/>
having an unseasonably cool summer.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those that have come up here to letterbox, this would not be the time to return. This morning Gwen &amp; I woke up to about 6 inches of snow, and since then the intensity has increased. I had to suffer, as I had to step gingerly out our bedroom door this morning to reach the spa. There is something really cool about drinking a cup of coffee with the white stuff floating down, and steam rising all about. <br/>
 I thought that anyone wishing to come up for a few letterboxes should put February 18-21 on their calendar. It will be Whiskey Flat weekend and reservations are necessary for the motels, but there are many activities for non letterboxers. Art shows, western exhibits, gunmen having mock gunfights in the streets,rodeo, all sorts of events. Normally we try to hibernate in our little hillside abode, with so many folks in town, but it is great fun for those coming into Kernville. You would not be able to reach our high country letterboxes, but there is enough letterboxes available to keep you busy all weekend.  Another date to watch for is September 23-26, 11th Annual Turkey Vulture Festival.<br/>

If you were to draw a line from Bakersfield to Ridgecrest it would come <br/>
pretty close to Kernville, which is near the bottom of the Sequoias.<br/>

The Kern River runs into and through Lake Isabella.<br/>

The Western Divide Hwy was just opened on 5/15, and now all of our <br/>
high country boxes may be available.<br/>
It was dang cold over Memorial Day and the river dropped from 4000 <br/>
cfs to about 1600cfs. The temp is starting to rise and we are <br/>
currently about 75*.<br/>
