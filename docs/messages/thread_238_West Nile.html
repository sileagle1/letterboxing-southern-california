  Our son lives very close to El Dorado Park on the east side of Long Beach and borders west Orange co. They have been seeing many dead crows in the park, and have been told to remain indoors at dusk as much as possible. When folks ask you what is that aftershave or perfume you are wearing just say it is "Cutter Evergreen- I'm a Letterboxer!".<br>
