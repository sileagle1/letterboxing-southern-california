managed to be the first finder of Got Gwapes a really cute stamp at <br>
a neat location, also found Citizen Cane's Rosebud and on the way <br>
back to Bakersfield stopped near Buttonwillon to get Tule Elk at <br>
10pm in the pitch dark. (My boyfriend says that I really need to <br>
seek help for my letterboxing addiction although he seems to be <br>
hooked too!)<br>
<br>
Also got to plant Money from the Sea in Cayucos, did I mention it's <br>
my favorite beach town? <br>

Who's going to San Francisco to the gathering?<br>
