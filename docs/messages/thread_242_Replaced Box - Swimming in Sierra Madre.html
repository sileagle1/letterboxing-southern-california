<br/>
I replaced the Sierra Madre box yesterday.  Same stamp, slightly<br/>
different location. Being an Urban Letterbox, I took the liberty of<br/>
adding a little more concrete to the scenery.  We'll see if this box<br/>
stays put.<br/>

   I am sure none of you know me, well actually that  might not be entirely <br/>
true, i do post on the main list occasionally and the  letterboxing northeast <br/>
more often. Anyway, what i was wondering, is if you all  woulnd't mind giving <br/>
me a hand, i am traveling along with my 2 children to San  Diego, i am in <br/>
Massacusetts now, we are leaving on Wednesday and will be there  almost a week. If <br/>
you could send me some clues for San Diego that would be  wonderful!!!   I <br/>
could only find one on the website  :-(      Thanks so much for your  help!!!!<br/>

Letterboxing hasn't really taken off in San Diego County, yet, but <br/>
there are a few boxes. There's a lot of boxes in Orange, Los Angeles, <br/>
and Ventura Counties.  What route will you be taking through <br/>
California?<br/>

HI Buzzard,<br/>
   Actually we are flying into San Diego, and staying right there. I was <br/>
really hoping to find a few, but atleast one would be good........we are going to <br/>
be bringing a HH with us, a brand new one, that we are hoping someday, that is <br/>
may make it back home to us. Thanks for any help you have for us!!<br/>
