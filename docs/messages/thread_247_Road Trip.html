                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi SoCal folks,<br>
We finally found a reliable phone hookup at a campground and picked up our mail, which consisted of 12 reports from finders on letterboxes, 4 from friends and relatives, and 113 messages from the Viagra/Cialis/software/porn spammers. Do you know how long it takes to receive some of this junk we get, when you get it all at once?  Our Enigma/Illusion/Opposites series for the Mammoth/Mono Lakes area is nearly finished and we will hopefully get a chance to post it at the end of July.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Folks,<br>
Gwen & I are back in Kernville from our "Find the cooler weather road <br>
trip". We did find some cooler weather as well as a few letterboxes. I <br>
want to appologize to anyone that tried to send us email. Just before <br>
we left I cranked our spam protection up to max and that created a few <br>
bounced messages. One thing that was curious though was that <br>
the "contact the placer function" got through the barrier and we did <br>
receive updates on several of our letterboxes. Not only did we find <br>
several letterboxes but left a few in our wake and anyone traveling up <br>
395 should check the gold country area for a few more. We did replace <br>
the Fossil Falls letterbox near Little Lake and it has a new location <br>
and a new stamp. Lee and Nancy should love this image and since both <br>
the stamp is new and the location at the Falls is new we have added <br>
this one to our placed count and we now have a 200 P total. Hope <br>
everyone is having a good summer.<br>

I've been off list for a while and am just catching up.  <br>
Congratulations from me on your 200th plant.  It seems like only <br>
yesterday I was the second finder of your 100th plant.  Actually it<br>
was <br>
8/17/03, and the first finder was, I think, California Bear. I<br>
haven't <br>
been doing a lot of letterboxing lately, but I did hide one WOM<br>
stamp, <br>
though I haven't given anyone the clues to it as yet.  I need to get<br>
to <br>
work on my new Halloween stamps for this year. I hope to see you guys <br>
in Kernville one of these days; I'm told my Kernville Coach is<br>
missing.<br>
Still gotta carve a new Buzzard stamp.<br>
