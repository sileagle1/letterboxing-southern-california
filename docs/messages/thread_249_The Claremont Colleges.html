Since I knew it would likely hit 100 degrees in the inland valleys <br/>
today, I was up at 6AM to head 25 miles east of Pasadena to seek "The <br/>
Claremont Colleges" series of letterboxes.  I left my walking stick <br/>
behind, because I figured I'd be wandering around expensive,<br/>
private <br/>
graduate school grounds which would probably not require any stream <br/>
crossings, or treacherous loose-gravel trail descents (by the way, <br/>
you can find these sorts of fun wilderness experiences on my newly <br/>
placed Tiburcio Vasquez letterbox series).  <br/>
<br/>
I was right.  These letterboxes are very civilized, as are their <br/>
subject matter:  Four great novels, illustrated by four great stamps, <br/>
planted in four great locations.  MD, how did you ever discover the <br/>
hiding place for your "dragonflight" LB, it is inspired?!  <br/>
<br/>
Besides great stamps, I was also rewarded on this trip with some <br/>
other gifts.  First, there was the "Arrrg. . .Hitchhiker,"<br/>
which I <br/>
found in the "To Kill a Mockingbird" LB.  Then there was the<br/>
flag pin <br/>
left in "The Flamingo Rising" LB, probably left by the 3 Dumb Blondes <br/>
who stamped in on July 4th.  Finally, there was the Claremont <br/>
Colleges keychain, which someone put in "The Sandman"<br/>
letterbox.  I <br/>
wasn't the first stamp, but no one else had taken it, so I helped <br/>
myself.  <br/>
<br/>
The campuses were beautiful, and the temperatures were cool, since I <br/>
started out so early.  A security guard kept driving by me in his <br/>
electric golf cart, seeing me again and again all over the campuses, <br/>
but never stopping to investigate my business.  I guess I looked <br/>
harmless with my backpack, and my bottle of water, and my colored ink <br/>
stamps lying out on various benches.  Thanks for the great morning <br/>
letterboxing!  I also left something behind in one of your <br/>
letterboxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Buzzard! So glad you enjoyed the boxes. I think it's funny that <br/>
you came to Claremont to cool off...I've been driving to Pasadena <br/>
and hiking in insane heat. :-)<br/>

Re: First Finder Goodies. I had never been the first to a letterbox <br/>
before, so I had no idea that people placed little gifts in them for <br/>
first finders. (which is why I missed taking the awesome little item <br/>
left in one of your Eaton Canyon boxes!) The 3 Dum Blondes were the <br/>
ones who told me about that, after they found one of my boxes. So I <br/>
went and planted first finder goodies in all of my boxes, even <br/>
though some of them had already been found. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
