 There is a special bonus for the first finder!  My son left a 14-band radio<br/>
somewhere near the box.  : ( I now own a 14-channel paperweight since I no<br/>
longer have the other radio.<br/>
<br/>
I also didn't stamp my log book with my own stamp!  It was not the best weekend<br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
In any event, the area is very beautiful, even in August in the middle of a<br/>
drought.  If you read the clues, you may notice that there are two ways to get<br/>
to the box (fireroad or trail).  Even though the fireroad is a little shorter, I<br/>
recommend that you take the trail at least one way.  It has some really<br/>
beautiful views, especially in late afternoon.  There is even one spot where you<br/>
can see the ocean between two peaks.<br/>
