                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks C Bear ! We are back in Kernville for a few days and will be <br/>
able to catch up on updating clue sheets. From the "Contact the <br/>
placer" traffic we have a few clue sheets to edit. There could have <br/>
been a mini-meet at The Curlew Box. <br/>
<br/>
No Buzzard, there wasn't a copy to be had where we were. We  be <br/>
going to travel way down to Bakersfield and hopefully they will sell <br/>
us a copy if we pick the hay outa our britches.<br/>
