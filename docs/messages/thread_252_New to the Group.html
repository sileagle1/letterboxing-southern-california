                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I am located in Altadena CA and my family likes to hike.  From some <br>
Girl Scout yahoogroups I kept hearing about Letterboxing and <br>
Geocaching but only recently did some internet research.  <br>
<br>
Since I also love to stamp, the letterboxing really appeals to me <br>
and my husband is also interested to see if we can actually find <br>
anything.<br>
<br>
There seem to be quite a few boxes around the area for us to try, <br>
but I notice from the emails on this list that sometimes they seem <br>
to go missing.  Any hints for a newby on a box in the Pasadena area <br>
that we can probably find?  Also, is there somewhere to see some <br>
stamps?  I would love to create one for our family.<br>
<br>
After I have tried this a bit, I thought I would introduce my Girl <br>
Scout troop to the idea.  They are 5th graders - has anyone done <br>
this with a group?  I thought I could hide a box and have them find <br>
it.  If we look for other people's boxes, would each girl (about 10) <br>
stamp in the book, or should we create a troop stamp?<br>
<br>
Thanks and any help is appreciated.<br>

Hi Kathi,<br>
<br>
Can't tell you anything about the Pasadena area boxes (haven't made it <br>
up there from Orange County yet, but planning to soon). Maybe Buzzard <br>
or Q could answer that one. As for seeing some stamps, you can see <br>
Silent Doug's at his webpage:<br>

For tips on letterboxing for kids, check out the LBNA kids section:<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/kids/kidstamp.htm<br>
and also<br>
http://www.geocities.com/pragerr/SkylandLetterboxing/stampmaking.html<br>
<br>
I've seen logbooks where each child in a girl or boy scout troop <br>
stamped in individually. You could do both a troop stamp and individual <br>
stamps.<br>
<br>
Fair warning: I tried to help my 10 year-old carve his first stamp this <br>
week. He found it somewhat frustrating. He picked an image that I had <br>
hoped would be easy to carve, but he found it difficult. If your girls <br>
are going to carve their own stamps, encourage them to keep the image <br>
as simple as possible.<br>

First of all, welcome to letterboxing which is a family-friendly, <br>
economical, artistic, brain-challenging hobby. Since you're located <br>
in Altadena, you're fortunate to live in one of California's <br>
letterboxing hotspots; despite the size of our state, there aren't <br>
all that many areas that qualify for this distinction.  Other <br>
California letterboxing hotspots are the city and surrounding areas <br>
of Long Beach, San Luis Obispo, Kernville, and San Francisco.  There <br>
are also quite a few letterboxes spread about in Orange, Ventura, and <br>
Santa Barbara counties.  (No doubt there are also quantities of <br>
letterboxes in other northern California counties of which I am <br>
ignorant.)<br>

<br>
Most letterboxers post updates to their clues when they get a report <br>
that the box is missing. I haven't always been as quick to do<br>
this as <br>
I should, but at the moment, all of my posted clues mention if the <br>
box is missing, or has been reported missing (not the same thing).  I <br>
believe most of the letterboxes within 10 miles of Altadena are still <br>
in place.  Not finding a box is just part of letterboxing; you have <br>
to accept the serendipitous nature of the prey you are pursuing, and <br>
delight when the journey ends successfully.  That said, you'll <br>
definitely find some local letterbox successes with the following <br>
letterboxing.org listed boxes:  "The Other Canyons Series" (a<br>
hot <br>
hike during the summer), "Ranger's Arroyo Seco Series,"<br>
"The <br>
Halloween Series," or the newly placed "Tiburcio<br>
VasquezThe Repetto <br>
Ranch Raid."  <br>

<br>
Since you mentioned that you love to stamp, maybe you've already <br>
carved your own.  Here's a link to a Web page that shows<br>
expert-level <br>
letterbox stamp carving.  It is not necessary to carve stamps that <br>
are as beautiful as these in order to plant a successful letterbox.  <br>
I've certainly never carved as beautiful a stamp as one of these <br>
examples by Der Mad Stamper, but many letterboxers still like my <br>
letterboxes:    <br>

<br>
If a letterboxer has carved their own personal stamp, then they <br>
should stamp it into any letterbox they have found.  If they are with <br>
a group of letterboxers, each member of the group stamps their own <br>
personal stamp into the stamp book.  It's up to your troop's<br>
interest <br>
in the hobby if each member wants to create their own personal stamp, <br>
or create one that represents the whole troop.  <br>
<br>
Before going out letterboxing, you should read the letterboxing FAQ <br>
located at:<br>
<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html<br>
<br>
That will answer most of your questions.  Good luck!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think letterboxing is a great thing to introduce to a Scout group. It combines artistry (stamp creation) with navigation (following the clues, somtimes including compass work) and hiking.<br>
<br>
There is a 4-H Club in the L.A. Area that has planted several boxes.  I'm not sure how many kids are in that group but it seems like they all do this together.  I've never seen a box that they visited so I don't know how they handle the stamp in process.  I have seen groups of 5-6 where each person stamped in individually.<br>
<br>
As for having a group stamp vs. individual stamps, I would lean toward individual stamps.  While it is more work to create the stamps and takes longer to stamp in if travelling as a group, having your own stamp also personalizes the experience more than all of them having to share the same stamp.<br>
<br>
A suggestion to make the stamp creation process easier is to use fun foam glued to a block of wood.  Shapes can be cut out with scissors which is much safer than giving an Exacto knife or sharp carving tool to the kids.  You can find Fun Foam at craft stores like Michaels for something on the order of $0.80 for an 8x10 sheet.<br>

I have some of the stamps I've carved on a couple of tutorials I <br>
created.  The Carving 101 tutorial only has an image of a single <br>
stamp I carved--but shows you how I carved it--at <br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/tutorials/carving<br>
<br>
I also have a stamping tutorial--there's more to stamping than meets <br>
the eye (*wink*)--where I use several of my stamps as examples--that <br>
you can see at http://www.atlasquest.com/tutorials/stamping<br>

In terms of kid-friendly boxes in your area, I'd recommend the <br>
Descanso Gardens boxes. They seem very popular with kids and are <br>
located in a large, pretty area where there are often school bus <br>
trips. Also, at least two of the boxes are located around the "fairy <br>
forest" in Descanso, which  means the kids can also look for fairies <br>
and stone squirrels and things that the are hidden in the Gardens as <br>
well. <br>
<br>
Re: finding boxes that haven't gone missing...check the date that <br>
the box was placed, or look for a "last reported" date. If either <br>
date is within a couple of months of the day you look, your chances <br>
are pretty good that its still there. I've searched for maybe 30 or <br>
so boxes, and only a handful were missing. I don't think a lot of <br>
them go missing...it's just that when one does, people post about it <br>
a lot because it's so sad!<br>
<br>
Hope that helps a little!<br>
