Q,<br>
This whole project is really cool.  Congratulations on completing <br>
such a huge endeavor!  I'm totally taken aback.  <br>
<br>
Since I walk my ill-tempered pitbull-mix dog every night near the <br>
spot where you planted "Yellow Kangaroo," I found it an easy <br>
hitchhiker to pick up <br>
(about 20 minutes ago).  Business will shortly take me north or east--<br>
north to Santa Barbara, and/or east to Kernville.  Either direction <br>
will bring this letterbox closer to New York. Lovely stamp!! Thanks! <br>
