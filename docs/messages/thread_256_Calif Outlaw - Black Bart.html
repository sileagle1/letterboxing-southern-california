<br>
Are either of you planning on making a Black Bart letterbox? I'm <br>
thinking of planting one in San Francisco this weekend. Seems like <br>
one of you wanted to do this one???<br>
<br>
For the Gathering this weekend, I'm planning on wearing my LBNA <br>
shirt and taking those signs that you made Don!<br>

I have a stamp carved, but go for it. Mr. Boles certainly robbed enough stages to deserve more than one letterbox. Look how many letterboxes Tiburcio Vasques has in his honor(geeze that is certainly no pun). See you should have kept the super sized stamp to make more shirts.<br>
