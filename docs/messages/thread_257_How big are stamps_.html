As you can imagine, most letterbox stampbooks are small in size. This <br/>
is a necessity given the clandestine nature of letterboxes, which <br/>
require that as small a waterproof container as possible be hidden to <br/>
help <br/>
prevent disclosure.  My personal stamp is about 2 inches square, and <br/>
has more or less fitted every stamp book I've encountered, but I <br/>
wouldn't recommend going much above this size for a personal<br/>
stamp. <br/>
(I know of a family stamp much larger than this size [S.P.C.A.]; but <br/>
this stamp is a work of art, and I think not so very practical for a <br/>
stamp-in to the modern, smaller, micro-boxes of today's<br/>
letterboxes.)<br/>

to fit.  Most logbooks will usually handle 2x2 inches pretty well, <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have two signature stamps--one extra small for those <br/>
microboxes--and a more 'normal-sized' (I used this term loosely <br/>
here) stamp for the more normal-sized boxes.  =)<br/>
<br/>
And then some people carve large stamps, but then just stamp a <br/>
portion of it if the logbook is small.  So if you've carved an <br/>
animal, you could just stamp the head--or something like that.  <br/>

the idea of turning them into a race!<br/>

  I love it when Scott, Pam ,and Carson (SPCA) find one of the micro boxes. Sometimes the eye of the Elephant or the eye of the Fish is used to stamp in. Size matters only if you are concerned about putting the entire image on a log book page.  <br/>
