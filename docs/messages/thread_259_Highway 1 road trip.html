                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a quick update on finds and misses on our Highway 1 road trip.<br>
<br>
Mission Santa Barbara, by Sierra Sally: we were first finders on this <br>
box! Logbook was soaked so we dried it out and bagged the logbook. <br>
Great stamp!<br>
Mission La Purisima Conception, by Sierra Sally:	First finders <br>
again great stamp and found the Unicycle HH.<br>
Ocean"o", by Judy from AG, Sleepy Cat and Princess Lea:	Found in <br>
great shape!<br>
Shady Coyote, by Don and Gwen:	Found in great shape!<br>
BMW OH-2, by Maddogbmw: Found also in great shape! Cool stamp but we <br>
drove our Mini Cooper to get to it.<br>
The Bookstore Box, by Ryan Carpenter: Alive and well, had to buy <br>
books to cover our actions! Fun box!<br>
Fluttering Kings, by jennby:	we had a tough time finding this one, <br>
but we did. Box is in great shape.<br>
Santa Ines Mission, by Sierra Sally:	Again first find, this is a <br>
must series we enjoyed the ones we found and the missions. Thanks <br>
Sierra Sally for the fun.<br>
Drove to the Nojoque Falls and the Turtle box by Don and Gwen: but <br>
found The Solvang Letterbox by Amanda from Seattle's box. Not sure <br>
what happened with the Turtle?<br>
We attempted the Los Osos Oaks series. We didn't find the first box <br>
and due to use both wearing shorts and all the poison oak around we <br>
gave up. Next trip!<br>
Painted Cave, by Don and Gwen: we could not find this one, not sure <br>
if it is missing or we just missed on the clues. The cave and the <br>
drive were great!<br>
We wish we had had more time to find more boxes in the central coast.<br>
We did plant a box in Pismo Beach, look for the clues soon.<br>
<br>
Thanks again, Jam n' Jelly <br>

Thanks for the update. From your note I take it that our Turtle box under the bridge may be missing, and it has been replaced by Amanda's LB? Or was our's missing and Amanda's where it should be? Now that you have made the trek to the SLO area you better schedule a trip to Kernville during the Fall/Winter.<br>

Amanda's was where your box should have been. We<br>
thought that was strange. Yes we are going to make it<br>
up to Kernville.<br>
If you could e-mail us off list about the Painted<br>
Cave. We think we found the area the box should have<br>
been in but we never want to say that a box is<br>
missing. Just might be our lack of clue<br>
interpretation.<br>

That's pretty bizarre.  What are the chances you were just looking <br>

We thought about that but Don & Gwen's clues matched<br>
this bridge. When I got back home I looked for<br>
Amanda's Solvang box on the site and didn't find it.<br>
Her stamp was incredible so we are happy to have found<br>
it. Just wanted D&G to know that the Turtle might be<br>
missing. Thanks for your Bookstore box, it was fun.<br>

She took it off LbNA--because it was missing!  DA-DA-DA!!!  And the <br>
plot thickens....  What happened to D&G's box?  Where did Amanda's <br>
reappear from?  Why did it move bridges?  Look for answers for these <br>

Is D&G's box at Amanda's bridge and who moved the<br>
turtle! It's the case of the hard shell switch a roo!<br>
<br>
Will Ryan figure this mystery out? Will Amanda shed<br>
light on the story? Will Don & Gwen find the Turtle?<br>
Stay tuned,<br>

At least we didn't get one of those "We went to your letterbox, but couldn't find it cuz it was missing, and your clues tell us to walk a certain way, why don't you tell us it was missing before we drive two miles and hike for ten minutes and not find your stupid box anyway" reports. Heck I was glad there was a letterbox for J&J to find. They never write the above reports I was just foolin.<br>

Amanda wanted to know what the stamp image was. Apparantly her's was under another bridge, before it went missing.<br>
<br>
The plot thickens, and the clues are being uncrambled. Now every one must come into the parlor, for a person by person interview. aahh so. The number one son keeps saying "But pop, but pop".<br>

  Is D&G's box at Amanda's bridge and who moved the<br>
  turtle! It's the case of the hard shell switch a roo!<br>
<br>
  Will Ryan figure this mystery out? Will Amanda shed<br>
  light on the story? Will Don & Gwen find the Turtle?<br>
  Stay tuned,<br>

Amanda's box need's a new log book, we were out of<br>

Ahhh, good, maybe we can get a solid lead on this strange turn of <br>
events....  =)<br>
<br>
I forgot about replacing the logbook in D&G's box.  For a brief <br>
moment I had been thinking maybe Amanda stamped into the new logbook <br>
making it look like it was her box, though it wasn't, at least until <br>
I heard the description of the stamp with the windmills.  That <br>
definitely was the Amanda stamp.<br>
<br>
Very perplexing indeed!  At least Amanda will be happy to know her <br>
box is back in action, raised from the dead.  =)  I hope she hasn't <br>
deleted the clues, though, because that'll make it much harder to <br>
find if clues are no longer available!<br>
