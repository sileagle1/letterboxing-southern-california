Pink Pig (Betty) and Purple Turtle (Elvira) left their starting boxes <br/>
in Long Beach this morning, beginning their long trek to New York City <br/>
(the crowd cheers!).<br/>
<br/>
Elvira headed up Signal Hill to enjoy one last panoramic view of the <br/>
Pacific before heading east. But wait--what's this?! She sputtered out <br/>
when she reached the top! She's settled into the Signal Hill Letterbox <br/>
for a breather! Well race fans, it looks like it's going to be a long <br/>
trip to the east coast for the turtle. Someone had better go pick her <br/>
up for the next leg of the journey.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Betty is making plans to head north up the California Coast <br/>
very soon. Stay tuned for news of her 1st pit stop on the race to New <br/>
York!<br/>

At this point, I will only be able to move one of them a few miles up or down the coast.  That won't help much in the final goal.<br/>
