I see our mistake now. We veered too far north when searching for <br>
Always Faithful. NOW that we have the clarifying clues, Dr. Moriarty <br>
CLAIMS he suggested looking in the right direction, but I don't quite <br>
remember it that way. :)  Still, he was right about the identity of V's <br>
descendants, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.<br>
