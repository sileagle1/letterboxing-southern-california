   I got an email from someone that they went to my Agriscapes box <br>
and because there were spiders on the tree that it was hung in they <br>
tossed the box under the tree instead of rehiding it by hanging it <br>
in the tree. <br>
    Would someone go to Agriscapes and put the box where it belongs <br>
before it gets picked up and thrown away?<br>
<br>
I live 4 hours away from that box and can't get down there for a <br>
couple of months.<br>
<br>
Thanks Much<br>
Sierra Sally<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hehe - when I went to hunt this box, my boyfriend waited in the car <br>
while I poked around in the tree. After a minute he rolls down the <br>
window and says, "Uh, you better let me find it..." All these hornets <br>
had come swarming out of the tree, but I was so focused on the <br>
letterbox I didn't notice. I'm allergic to yellowjackets, but he <br>
couldn't see what they were - just that there were lots of them! He <br>
did the gallant thing and retrieved and returned the letterbox for <br>
me :)  -Q<br>
