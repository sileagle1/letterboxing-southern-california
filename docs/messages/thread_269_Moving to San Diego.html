but wanted to say hi - I'll be moving to the San Diego area within a <br/>
month or two.  Looks like boxing in the San Diego area is a little <br/>
sparse, but no more so than in Colorado (where I currently reside).  <br/>
We'll have to fix that!  I can't wait to visit all the boxes that <br/>
I've been reading about on this talk list, as well as plant a few <br/>
myself.  Looking forward to meeting you -<br/>
<br/>
Cattail  :)<br/>

   I just read your email about moving to San Diego, we  are back now from <br/>
our visit there, we were only able to find one the letterboxes  in San Diego, <br/>
and while we were there, we left something native to  Massachusetts, hoping that <br/>
it will eventually find its way back  home.............Cattail maybe you will <br/>
find it if you are going there to visit  before you move, or maybe, someone <br/>
has already found it and moved it  along...........let me know if any of you <br/>
find my friend.<br/>
