missing. Darn gardeners!<br/>
#2 &amp; #3 are fine. #2 box was not covered. <br/>
<br/>
Please, please remember to re-hide and cover boxes when out hunting. <br/>
So much time and effort is put into planting boxes. It's a shame for <br/>
them to be lost just because we haven't taken the time to re-hide <br/>
them better than we found them.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to thank all those who plant boxes for us to enjoy. Your <br/>
time and efforts are applauded.<br/>
