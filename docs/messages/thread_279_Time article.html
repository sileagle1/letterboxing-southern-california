on searches who didn't hide the boxes or who didn't replace the <br>
boxes or who took things from the boxes, not understanding that it <br>
wasn't a treasure hunt. I totally sympathesize with newbies, being a <br>
relative newbie myself. And you have to start somewhere. Newbies <br>
keep the hobby alive! But for some reason, it seems like several of <br>
the people I've talked to who read the article were still really <br>
confused about what they were doing, or had culled the clues from <br>
letterboxing.org without reading any of the info about the hobby on <br>
the site. <br>
<br>
So I was just curious if others have noticed this as well, or it's <br>
just coincedence that I keep running into Time-related-confusion. :-<br>
