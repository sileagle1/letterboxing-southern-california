I guess my point is that there should be a easier, more well-defined <br/>
way to bring newbies into the hobby, since I think mass confusion is <br/>
pretty common. I know there's a newbie talk list, but I don't know <br/>
how the newbies would necessarily find it. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should have an Adopt-A-Newbie program? :-)<br/>

I didn't think your first post sounded snotty. You voiced legitimate <br/>
concerns about the way some folks fail to preserve boxes for FUTURE <br/>
newbies to find.<br/>
<br/>
I'm suspicious, though, that many of the boxes that get left out in the <br/>
open or lost are, in fact, found accidently by noxers (muggles, <br/>
mundanes, non-letterboxers, or whatever nomenclature you prefer). Every <br/>
time I find a letterbox in a planter (or any other foliage that is <br/>
maintained by human hands), I marvel that a gardener hasn't thrown it <br/>
away months earlier.<br/>
