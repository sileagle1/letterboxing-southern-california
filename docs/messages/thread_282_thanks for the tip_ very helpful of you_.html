Ugh.... Don't get me started.  *nursing my poor, broken-down knees*<br>
<br>
I plan to go out again tomorrow afternoon and pick up from where I <br>
left off.  Or rather, pick up from where I should have been had I not <br>
gotten off for a couple of days.  I set a little too ambitious of a <br>
hiking schedule this time around, I fear.  *sigh*<br>
