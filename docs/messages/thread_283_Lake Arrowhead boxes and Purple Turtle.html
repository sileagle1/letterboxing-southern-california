                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all! I had a good day at Lake Arrowhead, retrieving 6 of the 7 <br>
boxes I searched for, so I thought I'd give an update in case anyone <br>
else wants to head that way. In the order that I found them:<br>
<br>
- Mormon Lumber Road. <br>
Looking good!<br>
<br>
- Rim of the World Drive. <br>
Everything at this turn-off is under construction EXCEPT for the one <br>
wall where the box is! :-) Hopefully that means the wall isn't <br>
slated for construction. Otherwise, if you haven't picked up this <br>
fabulous stamp yet (I love Chowder's stamps) this might be your last <br>
opportunity, depending on what happens with that wall.<br>
<br>
- Crest Park Picnic Area<br>
Closed to the public! (ahem)  So I just sort of....got there <br>
early....pulled off to the side of the road...and darted down the <br>
path towards the picnic area. Fire has destroyed a good chunk of <br>
this park and they are in the process of bringing down trees. The <br>
Rotary thing in the clue is still there, and the tree where the <br>
letterbox is hidden is also still standing. However, that particular <br>
tree was tied with blue plastic tape...I don't know if that means it <br>
is being slated for tear down or being saved. The box was still <br>
there and in good condition, but it's hard to say if it will stay <br>
there because of the state of the place. <br>
<br>
- Rock Camp<br>
Looking good!  And guess what? *****This is where Purple Turtle, one <br>
of the hitchhiking critters from Q's race to NY, stopped!*****<br>
<br>
- Grass Valley Lake<br>
Looking good!<br>
<br>
-Tunnel II Trail<br>
The only one I gave up on. And it's so frustrating because I know <br>
it's there....it was just replaced this month. But the area is just <br>
a mess, since they're removing trees, and I couldn't tell what was a <br>
footpath from a tractor path from a tree clearing. I was also <br>
concerned about getting lost. So no Tunnel Trail box for me. :-(<br>
<br>
- Dragon Woods. New and alive. My last find of the day. Yay!<br>
