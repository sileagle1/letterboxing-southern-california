If you get a chance to go 20-30 min north of Encinitas there are two boxes in San Clemente (one I just planted last weekend).  And in Laguna Hills I recently planted one.  Both are in South Orange County.<br>

I'll be down in the San Diego area at the end of the week and am hoping to get out to do a <br>
couple of letterboxers (depends on if I can convince anyone with a car to go with me). Can <br>
anyone bring me up to date on what might be missing so I can avoid any wild goose <br>
chases (my "A" count is quite high enough already). I think we are staying in Encinitas. <br>
Wish I could get up north to the Pasadena area, but I think that would pushing my <br>
realtives' patience.<br>

P.S. How hot has it been down there? <br>
