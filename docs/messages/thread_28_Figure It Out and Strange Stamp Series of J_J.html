                    <div class="plaintext-content">This morning I took my wife on her 3rd letterboxing trip in search of <br/>
the "FIGure It Out," and 2nd &amp; 3rd box of Jam &amp; Jelly's "Strange <br/>
Stamp Series" (I'd already gotten the 1st stamp in this series).  <br/>
Although we greatly enjoyed the trip to this location in Santa Fe <br/>
Springs, we didn't find the 2nd stamp of the Strange Stamp Series.  <br/>
This LB is located in a particular tree that has a very deep cavity <br/>
for secreting letterboxes, and this morning I just wasn't in the <br/>
frame of mind to reach my arm three feet down into a spider web <br/>
infested gaping hole to fish around for the box.  It didn't seem to <br/>
be located in any friendlier locations behind this tree, so if it's <br/>
still there, I assume it's deep in the pit.  Don't get me wrong, it's <br/>
a fantastic hiding place, but for some reason I was squeamish this <br/>
morning.  If J&amp;J would be willing to confirm for me that this box <br/>
requires deep diving, I'd be happy to go back and take the plunge.  <br/>
(This box is located very close to Southern California Edison's <br/>
Whittier Service Center, which I sometimes find myself working at, so <br/>
it'd be an easy lunchtime grab.)  We were successful in finding the <br/>
3rd stamp in the series, and were thrilled to be the 1st stampers!  <br/>
As usual, a beautifully carved stamp by the Jam &amp; Jelly team. After <br/>
this find, we drove to the location of the "FIGure It Out" mystery <br/>
box.  This box is only a couple of days old, but we didn't find it, <br/>
and believe it to be missing. I even searched through the park's <br/>
trash cans thinking that some caretaker had found it, and tossed it <br/>
thinking it was garbage.  All I found in the trash was a Playboy <br/>
centerfold, hey, I mean I FOUND A PLAYBOY CENTERFOLD!!  At any rate, <br/>
maybe Purple Iris, who I believe lives in the area, will confirm if <br/>
this box is missing, or we're just lousy searchers.  Still, the total <br/>
was one beautifully carved stamp image outta three attempts, and a <br/>
great day boxing early in the morning in SoCal.  We were very happy, <br/>
thanks to all!<br/>
--Buzzard P6 F58 X-will be "1" after my wife finally carves her <br/>
letterboxing signature stamp!!<br/>

&gt; I found the "FIGure It Out" LB posting online not 30 minutes ago, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; already told my wife about it, and hope to go for it 1st thing <br/>
&gt; tomorrow morning!  If we get out early enough, I'll also try and <br/>
take <br/>
&gt; her to Jam &amp; Jelly's newly replaced LBs in Santa Fe Springs.<br/>
