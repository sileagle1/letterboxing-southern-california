  I went there and found only Amanda's box.  I looked under every bridge and only one had anything under it.  I even looked around in other spots that could possibly hide a letterbox and no such luck.  I followed Don and Gwens clues but found Amanda's box.  I have no Idea where the other box went.

When Ryan and I were at Nojoque Falls (April 9, 2004) We only found <br/>
the Nojoque Turtle box and not my Solvang box. The Turtle box also <br/>
had a full logbook and we replaced it with a new one and took the <br/>
full one to Don and Gwen during the Kernville Gathering (April 24, <br/>
2004)!<br/>
