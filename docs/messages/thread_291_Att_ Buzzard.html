Thanks for pointing out this photo and article.  (I remember you <br>
writing that you walked out on this bridge to find my letterbox <br>
without looking down.)  We Pasadena folk are very proud of our <br>
bridge, and celebrate it with a bridge festival every year. Because <br>
of this, I had to get through a phalanx of police, photographers and <br>
models to remove my bridge letterbox two days before the party this <br>
year.  Leslie also has a letterbox hidden underneath the <br>
bridge, 'bout 150 feet below mine (. . . black widow spider <br>
encounter, what is it about me and venomous arachnids).<br>

The bridge is often used for commercials, especially car commercials. <br>
Because the bridge is curved, which is very unusual, it makes for a <br>
particularly dramatic shot of a car swooping around a bend. It's one <br>
of the very few curved bridges in the world. If you stop to think <br>
about it, bridges are usually just built straight across a gorge; the <br>
shortest route for an expensive structure.  In this case, the ground <br>
of the arroyo underneath the bridge was deemed too soft in spots to <br>
handle the load, so a curved bridge was necessary to take advantage <br>
of harder islands of soil.  I've seen a photo taken in the 1920s of <br>
the barnstorming pilot of a Jenny flying his plane underneath the <br>
bridge, through the central span.  And of course, the bandito <br>
Tiburcio Vasquez and his gang rode their horses underneath this <br>
bridge, 70 years before its construction, during their escape from <br>
the Repetto Ranch raid.<br>
