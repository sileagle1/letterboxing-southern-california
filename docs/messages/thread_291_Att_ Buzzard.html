Thanks for pointing out this photo and article.  (I remember you <br/>
writing that you walked out on this bridge to find my letterbox <br/>
without looking down.)  We Pasadena folk are very proud of our <br/>
bridge, and celebrate it with a bridge festival every year. Because <br/>
of this, I had to get through a phalanx of police, photographers and <br/>
models to remove my bridge letterbox two days before the party this <br/>
year.  Leslie also has a letterbox hidden underneath the <br/>
bridge, 'bout 150 feet below mine (. . . black widow spider <br/>
encounter, what is it about me and venomous arachnids).<br/>

The bridge is often used for commercials, especially car commercials. <br/>
Because the bridge is curved, which is very unusual, it makes for a <br/>
particularly dramatic shot of a car swooping around a bend. It's one <br/>
of the very few curved bridges in the world. If you stop to think <br/>
about it, bridges are usually just built straight across a gorge; the <br/>
shortest route for an expensive structure.  In this case, the ground <br/>
of the arroyo underneath the bridge was deemed too soft in spots to <br/>
handle the load, so a curved bridge was necessary to take advantage <br/>
of harder islands of soil.  I've seen a photo taken in the 1920s of <br/>
the barnstorming pilot of a Jenny flying his plane underneath the <br/>
bridge, through the central span.  And of course, the bandito <br/>
Tiburcio Vasquez and his gang rode their horses underneath this <br/>
bridge, 70 years before its construction, during their escape from <br/>
the Repetto Ranch raid.<br/>
