                    <div class="plaintext-content">This morning I printed out the clues to about 10 or so different<br/>
letterboxes, grabbed my gear, my dog, and my dog's gear (tennis ball<br/>
&amp; leash) and headed out. The first letterbox on my list was the<br/>
Repetto Ranch Raid letterbox in Buzzard's Tiburcio Vasquez series. I<br/>
found the box with no problem and sat under a shady tree with my dog<br/>
to stamp in. While stamping in I noticed a dirty box under another<br/>
tree about 50 feet away. It looked out of place since the park is<br/>
somewhat of a playground and very pristine. I decided to check it out<br/>
once I rehid the letterbox. As I got closer I noticed there were some<br/>
flies swarming around the top and I immediately thought there was a<br/>
dead animal inside. When my dog, who was about six feet ahead of me,<br/>
starting whining as she approached the box, I knew what was in there.<br/>
Kittens, four of them. They looked up at me with their blurry little<br/>
eyes. I love animals so there was no question in my mind what I would<br/>
do. I picked up the box and noticed that it was totally infested with<br/>
ants. Fortunately I had a clean box in my car to put them in, and<br/>
later today they will be checked out at the vet thanks to a great<br/>
rescue group called the Paw'd Squad here in Burbank, CA. The group is<br/>
already inundated with homeless cats (one of their members is<br/>
fostering over 90 cats in their home!) so it looks like these guys<br/>
will be staying with me for a while. Free kittens, anyone?<br/>

Please please please spay or neuter your pets. -Q<br/>
