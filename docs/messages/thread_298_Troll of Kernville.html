  You see Don, it is possible to box in Kernville during the summer. I <br/>
  was in contact today with folks at SCE's Kernville Service Center (in <br/>
  Wofford Heights), and at a certain dragon located in Kernville, and <br/>
  am really lobbying my boss to send me up to these locations for "work <br/>
  reasons." I hope to have at least a 24 hour letterboxing spree on the <br/>
