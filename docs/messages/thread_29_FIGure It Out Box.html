Be sure you count from the first (ground-level) tie.  The fourth tie <br/>
runs right under the bush.  I placed the box at the left end of that <br/>
tie, on top of the next tie to the left, which sits lower.  I am <br/>
guessing that you either looked too far to the left, or you missed <br/>
the first tie, which sits flush with the ground.  Let me know if you <br/>
find it!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxin'!<br/>

French Hen and I took another crack at your "FIGure It Out" mystery <br/>
box, and found it this time!!  It so well blended in with the black <br/>
soil, I'm not sure that the first time I just missed it because of <br/>
the camouflage.  <br/>
<br/>
It was great meeting you at the SLO event.  It was so kind of your <br/>
husband to help me look for my lost glasses, which we found.  I told <br/>
your husband the lost glasses were probably located near another <br/>
letterbox that you all hadn't found at the time, and he accompanied <br/>
me there to help with the search, assuring me he wouldn't give away <br/>
the location to you.  <br/>
<br/>
At the SLO park, you mentioned to me that we should be thinking about <br/>
a Southern California LB event, and I agree.  I think El Dorado Park <br/>
in Long Beach would be the perfect spot.  It's a huge park with bike <br/>
paths, an archery range, a lake for fishing and boating, and a <br/>
wilderness area.  Gwen &amp; Don planted eight letterboxes in the park, <br/>
and I believe six of them are still there.  Lots of room for more <br/>
plants.  <br/>
<br/>
At the SLO event, I didn't get a chance to do an exchange with all of <br/>
you, but I figured we'd probably be able to get together some time <br/>
down here, being locals and all.  Your FIGure it Out stamp is <br/>
beautiful!!  Nice carving!<br/>

Good to see you in SLO, too! If you ever have occasion to visit <br/>
FIGure It Out again, let us know; if we're in the area, maybe we can <br/>
meet you and French Hen for coffee.<br/>
<br/>
As for a location for a So. Cal. gathering, at one point I was <br/>
thinking about Bonelli Park in San Dimas (a.k.a. Puddingstone).  When <br/>
we went looking for a box there, I was amazed at how beautiful that <br/>
part of the park was, but I think repeated visits there to scout <br/>
locations, plant boxes, etc. would get expensive.  San Dimas is also <br/>
a fairly dry area, letterboxing-wise.  Purple Iris and I have to get <br/>
carving and planting, I guess.  She seems like a nice lady.  Have you <br/>
met her?<br/>
<br/>
I am not familiar with Long Beach, but El Dorado Park sounds like a <br/>
nice possibility.    Is there an admission charge for El Dorado? If <br/>
Don and Gwen have already planted there, we'd be 6/20 of the way to <br/>
matching Sir B and Jugglermouse's count at the SLO gathering!<br/>

Last week, French Hen and I tried again to find "FIGure It Out," and <br/>
this time succeeded.  I thought at our previous attempt that perhaps <br/>
some other letterboxer was stamping in at the time of our visit, and <br/>
that was the reason we couldn't find i; but after seeing how well <br/>
your LB blends in with the surrounding black dirt, I'm not sure that <br/>
we just didn't miss seeing it.  This is a beautifully carved stamp!  <br/>
For my stampbook impession, I used an antiqued, green metallic stamp <br/>
pad color, and the image looks like a 19th century book publisher's <br/>
monogram--gorgeous.     <br/>
<br/>
I've been to Frank G. Bonelli Park once looking in vain for a <br/>
letterbox, and though it is a large park that would work perfectly <br/>
for a gathering, El Dorado Park in Long Beach is much larger, and <br/>
more diverse; however, there IS a $5 per car charge.  We'd have to <br/>
check with the park to see what deals can be had by renting a picnic <br/>
area.  I know they rent these areas, and maybe parking for the <br/>
parties is included.  I believe you'd fall in love with this park if <br/>
you saw it.  It's located right off the 605 Freeway, just north of <br/>
the 405 interchange.  Besides the Don &amp; Gwen boxes in this park, <br/>
there are also 9 other Long Beach boxes, and more in nearby <br/>
communities, so (as you mentioned) it's a richer territory than the <br/>
San Dimas area (unless you and Purple Iris get ambitious in the <br/>
coming months).  You make a good point about the expense of repeated <br/>
visits by us to plan and plant letteboxes, so this is something to <br/>
consider as well.  Thanks for planting the beautiful letterbox!!<br/>
