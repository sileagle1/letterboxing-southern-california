                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sunday is generally my letterboxing day, and this last Sunday was no <br>
exception. A couple of weeks ago, at the Critter's of Ennisbrook <br>
Series: Salmon Rushdie, I had picked up the "Baby Beaver" HH. So I <br>
figured the first stop on my "Westside" LB spree would be to Q's <br>
Hollywoof Kennel Hitchhiker hostel. This was the first time I hiked <br>
the Hollywood Hills when the air was clear enough for me to see ships <br>
at sea; a gorgeous morning. Sure enough, there was another HH in the <br>
hostel for me to trade with--and what an HH it was! I scored big <br>
time! It was Legerdemain's #157 Lincoln Hitchhiker!!!! I only have <br>
one other stamp from this legendary carver, K-Martha, an event stamp <br>
from the SLO Gathering. What a beautifully carved and presented stamp <br>
this HH is! I'm utterly thrilled! (Okay, enough with the exclamation <br>
points; it's a cool hitchhiker.)<br>
<br>
After leaving Runyon Canyon I headed south . . . oops, Wooly's <br>
Letterbox is something of a Mystery Box: can't give its location  <br>
away. But the spot is magical (not in the Disney sense), and I was <br>
happy to be 1st Stamp.<br>
<br>
After Wooly, I back-tracked to the Hollywood Farmer's Market (every <br>
Sunday on Hollywood Blvd) for a snack before heading over to UCLA to <br>
seek Moderndulcinea's "Joe Bruin" LB.  According to her clues <br>
Moderndulcinea is a Bruin, and she planted her letterbox this last <br>
Saturday. My wife is also a Bruin, and we were at UCLA this last <br>
Saturday buying "Bear Wear" at the UCLA store. Hey Moderndulcinea, if <br>
you saw a really tall bald guy with a beard, cool glasses, and a "Big <br>
Dog Barbecue" shirt, that was me.  It was so hot that day that in the <br>
botanical garden sheltering the letterbox, I could well imagine I was <br>
in a tropical rain forest. <br>
<br>
I had planned to go on to the "Matador" letterbox at Cal State <br>
Northridge, but the heat had sapped my strength, so I decided to <br>
travel back from Los Angeles to the cool environs of Pasadena (locals <br>
will snicker here; Pasadena is as hot in the summer as Kernville). <br>
What a great letterboxing weekend!!<br>
