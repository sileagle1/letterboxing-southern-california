Series, is missing. I confirmed it today; it's missing along with the <br/>
entire garden inside the Pasadena City Hall courtyard. Apparently <br/>
they're putting in a new garden, more beautiful than before, no <br/>
doubt; but I'll have to wait until they finish before replacing this <br/>
LB, unless I figure something else out.  <br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, Roger was able to find both Suicide Bridge and <br/>
Rialto Theater LBs, so they're still in place as of today.<br/>
