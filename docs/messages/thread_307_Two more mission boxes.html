Well Mutau Paul and I had the chance to put out two more Mission <br/>
boxes. We also tried for several Newport Beach boxes and came up <br/>
empty. <br/>
<br/>
Box #1 for Three Birds of Kells is missing, we didn't have time to <br/>
look for the other two. <br/>
<br/>
Corona Del Mars - we found the spot and could see where it was <br/>
supposed to be, but the slope is VERY STEEP, and decided it wasn't <br/>
worth the trip to the hospital. <br/>
<br/>
We did find the Pirate Booty, and what fun! We ended up taking a <br/>
Pirate Cruise for 3 hours and had a ball. This one is a must!<br/>
