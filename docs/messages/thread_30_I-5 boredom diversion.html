Bakersfield. For those heading north to the SLO or SF gatherings it <br/>
is a quickie. Picnic tables, shade trees and guaranteed Elk viewing <br/>
all can be found at this little oasis. It is just minutes off I-5 and <br/>
the Elk are truly fantastic.The Elk from this reserve have been <br/>
distributed at various herds throughout California. There are several <br/>
wild herds in Lone Pine to Bishop area as well as the Carrizo Plain <br/>
and Grizzly Island areas. Look under "Tule Elk" in section 5 on the <br/>
map for the letterbox listing. Don  <br/>
