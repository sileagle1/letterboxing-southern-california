&gt; Hi Gang,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well Mutau Paul and I had the chance to put out two more Mission <br/>
&gt; boxes. We also tried for several Newport Beach boxes and came up <br/>
&gt; empty. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box #1 for Three Birds of Kells is missing, we didn't have time to <br/>
&gt; look for the other two. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Corona Del Mars - we found the spot and could see where it was <br/>
&gt; supposed to be, but the slope is VERY STEEP, and decided it wasn't <br/>
&gt; worth the trip to the hospital. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We did find the Pirate Booty, and what fun! We ended up taking a <br/>
&gt; Pirate Cruise for 3 hours and had a ball. This one is a must!<br/>
