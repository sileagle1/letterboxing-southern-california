                    <div class="plaintext-content">This last weekend I managed to finally replace box #2 in the Seal Beach Town Tour. For those that are quite sick of reading plaques you will be pleased that the replacement has no such requirements. Now on the other hand I couldn't let an opportunity pass, so The Saint Paddy's Day Pub Crawl was also placed. This new letterbox has no plaque reading requirements, but you will have to find your way about, and decipher clues from the signs on the local pubs. I suggest that sampling be put off until you are sure that you have all of the signs written down correctly. Cheers.<br/>

Hmmm...  I did only ever get one of the two St Paddy micros, since one<br/>
was gone at the time.  Perhaps I should pop down there next week.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of memories, I just planted a box today that mentions your<br/>
personal history.  I could have just brought attention to the location<br/>
in its own right, but thought it would be fun to give it a<br/>
letterboxing connection.<br/>

Gwen and I have thought about putting a box there, but never figured <br/>
out a good stamp.<br/>
I do think that you should edit the clues at the end as you don't go <br/>
there for a cold brew and a sandwich, you order a Schooner,Special, and <br/>
an Egg.<br/>
That has been my typical order for the last 45 years. Well maybe <br/>
sometimes two Specials. Thanks for the mention in the clues.<br/>
<br/>
They do have some great Rootbeer for the non drinkers.<br/>
