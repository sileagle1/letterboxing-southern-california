Hi!<br/>
<br/>
We have a week of vacation NOV 6-14 and still haven't finalized a <br/>
destination.  We like to take hiking vacations (day hikes), but since <br/>
we've started letterboxing in July 2003, we also try to choose some <br/>
hikes that have a box (or more) along the way.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping some of you on this board may be able to provide some <br/>
advice.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Is early November an OK time to come to California?  From my <br/>
research on the Internet, it looks like the weather in the southern <br/>
portion would be in the 60s to low 70s, but may have some significant <br/>
rain.  Is this correct?<br/>
<br/>
2.  What areas/boxes would you recommend visiting?  We prefer hiking <br/>
on trails in natural areas when possible.  It looks like the San Luis <br/>
Obispo area might be good.  Comments?<br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate any information you could provide about hiking/boxing <br/>
in this area, and recommended time of year to visit.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

Glad to hear you'd like to come out our way.  Be warned though...due to <br/>
super high fire danger, ALL trails, campsites and mountain access roads are <br/>
closed in the Pasadena area, until sufficient rain falls.  Even short little <br/>
hikes are off limits.  Too bad, because I have some great boxes up there!! <br/>
Please check with the State Forest Service for more info in CA...We had bad <br/>
fires last year, and so everyone is being extra cautious...And good luck!<br/>

  Hi!<br/>

  portion would be in the 60s to low 70s, but may have some significant <br/>
  rain.  Is this correct?<br/>
<br/>
  That depends where you are going within the state. California has probably the most diverse weather, from seashore to the sierras to deserts.<br/>
<br/>
  2.  What areas/boxes would you recommend visiting?  We prefer hiking <br/>
  on trails in natural areas when possible.  It looks like the San Luis <br/>
  Obispo area might be good.  Comments?<br/>
<br/>
  SLO has some great letterboxes and the hikes are very excellant. I think the Montana de Oro area is probably one of the most spectacular seashores I have ever seen. Some of the interior area hikes would be perfect this time of year. The consentration of letterboxes is pretty good as well.<br/>
<br/>
  We have a pretty good consentration of letterboxes here in Kernville as well, and the higher altitude letterboxes should still be available. Weather wise- we aren't sure what the heck rain is. I'm hoping that would change and we get a little more water this year. Usually our first storms don't come in until Thanksgiving or later.<br/>
  You might want to contact Pete &amp; Wanda, Silent Doug, Ryan &amp; Amanda and they might give you an outsider's point of view regarding hikes, letterboxes, and such as they have been in most of the letterboxing areas in Ca.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope this helps.<br/>
