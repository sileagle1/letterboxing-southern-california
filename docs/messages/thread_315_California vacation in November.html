Hi again!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info you've provided so far re: our trip.<br/>
<br/>
We've booked a flight to LA and have a car rented.  Our tentative <br/>
plan is to drive north along the coast, hiking and looking for boxes <br/>
in Ventura, Sanata Barbara, and San Luis Obispo counties.  Of course <br/>
we also plan to visit the various wineries in the central coast area.<br/>
<br/>
We've started printing clues (and doing some preliminary decoding) <br/>
for boxes in this area.  We're looking at the letterboxing.org and <br/>
atlasquest sites for clues.  Are there any other personal sites that <br/>
have additional clues for boxes in this area?<br/>
<br/>
I haven't seen anything about any gatherings or events for early to <br/>
mid-November, but let us know if anyone would like to meet for an <br/>
informal exchange somewhere.  We'd also love to get any personal <br/>
recommendations for restaurants, wineries or hikes in this area.  You <br/>
can contact me off-list at kotlarek at wi.rr.com.<br/>
<br/>
If bad weather, fires or earthquakes occur, we will scrap this plan <br/>
and head a different direction!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like a good letterboxing vacation. Our letterbox in Ventura, "By Any Other Name" is missing as is our "Painted Cave" in Santa Barbara. If you want to spend most of one day exploring off shore you could try our "Two Too Simple". We do have a combination letterbox with Amanda at Nojoque Falls that should be close to your route. Ron's Ennisbrook Series is a nice walk and has a series signature stamp by a fairly mysterious letterboxer. You will find that with the number of letterboxes in the SLO area you will probably run out of time there.<br/>
