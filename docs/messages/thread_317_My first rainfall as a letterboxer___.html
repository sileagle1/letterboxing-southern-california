I was surprised to find that all of my letterboxes in Bronson Canyon  <br/>
survived the storms with the exception of one. And that one was <br/>
planted in a dry  creekbed (which is not so dry in torrential rain), <br/>
so can you blame it? Fortunately, the stamp survived but the logbook <br/>
and box were nothing but mud. <br/>
<br/>
Therefore, The Data Recovery Mission #1 is recuperating at home and I <br/>
will replace it as soon as I can. It's pretty pointless to go after <br/>
any of the others in the series, as this one is the reference point <br/>
for the others to make the full picture.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I planted two new letterboxes in the same area. The series is <br/>
called To the Batcave!<br/>
