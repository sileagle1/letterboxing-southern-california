I just returned from a 3-day working trip to Kernville.  There was a <br/>
lot of work to be done, so there was very little time for <br/>
letterboxing, especially since the days have grown shorter since my <br/>
last trip in April.  Still, I managed to plant two letterboxes, and <br/>
find two.  The two planted letterboxes are located at the Kern River <br/>
Preserve in Weldon, a dozen miles from Kernville proper.  And I <br/>
found "The Other One," and "Coccinellidae."  <br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you, the whole trip was worth finding Coccinellidae; this <br/>
is a spectacular hike followed by a spectacular letterbox stamp.  Don <br/>
says this is the most beautiful stamp he has ever seen, and I agree.  <br/>
During the walk up the canyon you pass waterfalls, mine entrances, <br/>
and negotiate fallen trees, all in an evergreen forest.  And the <br/>
fallen trees and pine needles and plants are covered with masses of <br/>
ladybugs.  There were spots where I could not see the forest bottom <br/>
for the red backs of massed ladybugs.  I've never seen anything like <br/>
it, it's spectacular.  Apparently this canyon is the winter home of <br/>
like every ladybug in California.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Pam &amp; Scott for the incredible letterbox stamp placed in this <br/>
incredible location.<br/>

Well, I'm very embarrased to admit it, but I could not find the bonus <br/>
box.  I did spend some time looking, but it was getting late, and it <br/>
was on my last day, and I had that 4-hour drive ahead of me (and it <br/>
was raining), so I didn't find the bonus box. I did, however, leave <br/>
Q's "Tan Dog" racer HH in the box, racing away to NYC.  <br/>
<br/>
I've also carved a WOM letterbox in homage to an encounter I had at <br/>
one of your Kernville LBs last April, which I wanted to plant up <br/>
there on this trip, but time did not allow. If I had planted it up <br/>
there on this last trip, I was going to leave the clues in an <br/>
envelope taped to your front door.  No problem; I can always plant it <br/>
in Seal Beach, and send you the clues. There were so many Kernville <br/>
letterboxes, so little time.<br/>

All you had to do was look up from the Lady bug box and you would have seen the X.<br/>
Did you get my message about Millard Falls? We have two new ones in Seal Beach. Pub Crawl and #2 in the tour.<br/>

Don,<br/>
First of all, what the heck were you doing in Argentina, hunting <br/>
Argentinian quail??  Second of all, there was a lot of twisted up <br/>
vegitation at this location; I saw all sorts of Xs.  You'd think I <br/>
would have better insight into how you and Gwen hide your <br/>
letterboxes, seeing as how I've found forty of them, but not in this <br/>
case. As I said, it was getting late, and I had violated the number <br/>
one most basic hiking safety tip:  I was by myself, and I hadn't told <br/>
anyone where I was going to be. So I gave up the search.  <br/>
<br/>
I saw the post of your Pub Crawl letterbox in Seal Beach (I have the <br/>
original #2 tour stamp [which was my 50th find]), but unfortunately <br/>
I've just been too busy traveling to Kernville, and Big Creek, and <br/>
Tehachapi, and decorating for Halloween (my favorite holiday), and <br/>
carving new Halloween Series LBs (info coming up) to get to them. <br/>
Plus California Bear always gets to your Seal Beach letterboxes first <br/>
(except for "Fish in the Reads").  <br/>
<br/>
I did not get your message about Millard Falls.  This was my first <br/>
D&amp;G letterbox (9th found) which I found on 3/29/03. What's going on <br/>
with Millard Falls?<br/>
<br/>
I had a great time in Kernville.  I've developed quite an affection <br/>
for this town, but it would never do for the French Hen; she's a city <br/>
girl (born in Manhattan), and gets nervous if there are no neon <br/>
lights and busy sidewalks around.<br/>

It wasn't quail, it was dove and pigeons. The X was very large, but you made the best choice as you can always come back. We are planning on retiring Millard Falls,Jack Creek Falls and some others we may not get back to replace. Since it is in your neighborhood we thought we should advise you about Millard Falls.<br/>
<br/>
We picked up The Preserve boxes today, and put out another at the Canebrake Ecological Reserve just down the road a piece.<br/>
