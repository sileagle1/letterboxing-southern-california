I carved a replica stamp from the original image and Peter replanted the letterbox and clarified the clues. With the cooler weather the hike to this letterbox and beyond is much more pleasant. For those interested in letterboxing history Lonewolf planted this letterbox on 3/4/99 on a visit to California. There was another series planted in June of 99 around the SF area but the letterboxes and clues disappeared. If you are interested you can go back in the archives of the chat list and find these old clues as that is how the clue sheets were originally posted. The Web Masters use to do all of the posting for the letterboxers rather than the way that they are presently posted by each planter. Next time you read something from Jay Drew, you should realize that "He was the guy " for California and did all of the inputting for clue sheets for us. Jay is a transplanted Californian and it seemed as if he would always post our clues quickly. The web Masters did a fantastic job(still do) and really don't get the credit due them for where the game/hobby is today.<br/>

That's awesome that you guys are keeping the history of letterboxing <br/>
alive! California has come a long way in the last couple of years. It <br/>
is great to see so many people who live in the area excited about <br/>
letterboxing! And not just those of us who visit the state.<br/>
