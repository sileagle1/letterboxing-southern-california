Buzzard are you familiar with the waterfalls up in Rubio Canyon in <br/>
Altadena? Or is anyone else? Would this be a very strenuous hike or <br/>
is it even possible to take a hike up there? Purple Iris<br/>

Purple Iris,<br/>
I'm familiar with the story of Rubio Canyon, which is not far from my <br/>
house, and have planned to hike up there, but haven't yet.  According <br/>
to the latest edition of John Robinson's book "Trails of the <br/>
Angeles," a landslide in 1998 took out most of the waterfalls. <br/>
Robinson lists the hike as "easy" in going as far as the destruction, <br/>
but the link below to "Roy's Hikes in Angeles National Forest" <br/>
details the current state of the canyon. Check out hike number 25.<br/>

Thanks, Buzzard,<br/>
Let me know if you get to hike there. Be careful, it sounds kind of <br/>
unstable. Have you done any of the other hikes on the website? I bet <br/>
a ot has changed since 1998. Purple Iris<br/>

Purple Iris,<br/>
A few weeks ago I hiked the original Mount Wilson Trail in Sierra <br/>
Madre to Orchard's Camp, the site of a 19th century wilderness hotel. <br/>
Here there remains foundations and a enormous 1500 year old oak tree, <br/>
the oldest in the San Gabriels. On the hike, you pass through an oak <br/>
forest and spot small acorns on the ground.  Standing before this <br/>
incredible tree, it's amazing to think that it came from one of these <br/>
little acorns that fell here in 500 A.D. <br/>

Milard Canyon?  Eaton Canyon is about a mile from the<br/>
bridge - maybe a mile and a half from the parking lot.<br/>
 Milard Canyon is more shady and through more rock,<br/>
but about the same distance.  You do need a forest<br/>
pass to park at Milard.<br/>
<br/>
If you are talking about the falls that were uncovered<br/>
from the recent rains, I am not sure what they are<br/>
like but am intersted.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Altadena.  A friend and I are excited about<br/>
placing boxes soon so stay tuned... The Halloween ones<br/>
in Pasadena were fun.<br/>
