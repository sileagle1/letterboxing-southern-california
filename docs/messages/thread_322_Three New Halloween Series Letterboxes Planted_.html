I just planted three new Halloween Series letterboxes in Pasadena.  <br/>
One is a re-plant of the "Scaredy Cat" letterbox, but with an <br/>
entirely new (and better) carving in a new location, so that makes it <br/>
a new letterbox.  The other two are "Black Widow" and "Candy Corn"; <br/>
brand new letterboxes in the series.<br/>
<br/>
Being urban letterboxes, this series has taken quite a few hits. Here <br/>
is the scorecard:<br/>
Number 1, the original Suicide Bridge letterbox is still in place.<br/>
Number 2, the Rialto Theater letterbox is missing.<br/>
Number 3, the replaced Memorial Park Moon is still in place.<br/>
Number 4, as noted above, the Memorial Park Scaredy Cat has just been <br/>
replaced with a new carving in a new location.<br/>
Number 5, the Charmed Witch was destroyed along with the garden at <br/>
Pasadena's City Hall.<br/>
Number 6, the original Halloween Series Ghost is still in place, <br/>
though I haven't checked it since the recent torrential rains.<br/>
Number 7, the new Black Widow Letterbox is in place as of today.<br/>
Number 8, the new Candy Corn Letterbox is in place as of today.<br/>

I decided to celebrate Halloween by hunting the new Scaredy Cat (nice <br/>
stamp!), Candy Corn, and Black Widow boxes. Thanks for a fun <br/>
afternoon :)  -Q<br/>
