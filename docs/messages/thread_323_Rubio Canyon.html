                    <div class="plaintext-content">I checked our California Waterfalls book and this hike is listed as a Hike-in & Scramble 2.0 miles RT/Moderate. Apparently the F.S. stopped maintaining the trail and posted a sign"Trail Unsafe for Hiking". You apparently have to scramble over a series of 6 ft falls in order to make your way to a 50 footer. Sounds somewhat iffy. The Ca. Waterfall book by Ann Marie Brown is a really super resource as Gwen & I were into chasing waterfalls before letterboxes.<br>
