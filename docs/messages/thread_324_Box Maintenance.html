                    <div class="plaintext-content">Gwen &amp; I just finished checking our Coyote Hole Stage Robbery series, and the road into #2,and #3 is in good shape. We both believe that 2 wheel drive cars would have no problem. The raptors are not nesting until early spring so access is not a problem. We then drove to Burro Schmidt Tunnel and believe that this road too, while more rutted than the road to Robbers Roost, is also passable by 2 wheel vehicles. Ground clearance is more of a concern and you should keep your brand new Corvettes off this road. We didn't check the BS Tunnel box as we left our flashlights at home. Duh! The caretaker is gone from the property and the house and immediate surrounding area has been trashed. Unless a new caretaker is found my guess is that BLM will be tearing down the house and possibly sealing the tunnel?? <br/>
