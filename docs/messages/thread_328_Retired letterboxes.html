Did Millard Falls Box come up missing?  Nancy and I just found that <br/>
box recently, on October 23, 2004.  There were a few other hickers at <br/>
the site, but we were very discrete and re-hid it well.  It is such a <br/>
beautiful site, I hate to see it get pulled.  The vertical Red &amp; <br/>
White sign mentioned in the clues no longer existed, but it was still <br/>
able to be found.<br/>
