In case the older SoCal members were a wondering, Lee & Nancy have been at it for quite a while, and we had the opportunity of doing an X at the Kernville gathering last April. They are in the High Desert area and have a few boxes scattered about. If you are heading toward Lost Wages from LA you can nab their boxes in route.<br>

If you would copy and paste the clue sheet for Millard Falls into your Word program then let me know and I will delete it from LBNA, AQ and then you can repost it. I guess it will be your baby to watch over. If you would keep my little sarcastic note in tact , and advise that it was my sentiment not yours that would be cool.<br>

Okay, I copied the clue sheet for Millard Falls into a Word document, <br>
and also printed out a copy for back up, so you can go ahead and <br>
delete it from LBNA and AQ. Let me know when it's gone, and I'll <br>
repost it. I'll take a walk up Millard Canyon this weekend with some <br>
first aid supplies in case the box needs a new stampbook or baggies. <br>
It's a really nice hike (and I have an Adventure Pass). I recently <br>
took the hike that travels above the waterfall, so was able to look <br>
down from the top. <br>
<br>
I would never presume to remove your sarcastic note, especially since <br>
I know about the incident that precipitated it. <br>
<br>
I hope Gwen is recovering nicely.<br>

Gwen is doing great! We both are happier as we just got back home to Kernville. Our little 1 bdrm Seal Beach apt was getting more than a little small. I too have a copy of the clues in Word, and I just removed the clue sheet from LBNA as well as AQ. This is going to wipe out F counts on AQ for you and Q. I didn't see any other finders listed for this box. This makes more sense to me as the clues will have to be changed as the verticle sign is no longer, and we haven't returned to the box in over 2 years. Thanks for understanding about the note, there is some education there as well as just a little bit of sarcasm.   Adventure pass Hah! wait til you reach 62 and get a freebie for life!  The Golden age one even gets you reduced fees on campgrounds and free admittance to all National Parks. It is one of the few things you can be thankful of when you reach 62. I wish we could make the GRR , but I have a major shoot that weekend and it is already paid for. I will be sending up a LB that you guys can hunt down.<br>
