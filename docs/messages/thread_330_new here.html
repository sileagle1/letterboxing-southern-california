Welcome to letterboxing. It is somewhat unusual when new folks stumble on to the SoCal list, as this list has fewer members than most. Here are some links that might help you in your pursuit of this game/hobby. While you can get your questions answered (if you have any) here, you might find that fishing for them at other sites is more fun. Now your F count is 2. Gwen & I have a letterbox that would be a good homeschooling lesson, but your children might be a little young? Check out "Stamp Golf" in Long Beach on the LBNA site www.letterboxing.org<br>
