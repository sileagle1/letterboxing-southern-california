Hi Don.<br>
<br>
It was with some interest and sadness we learned that the Wild Goose <br>
has been cooked! <br>
<br>
This was the third LB we ever found (after Dam Raccoon in Oroville <br>
and another one near there!) We were fortunate enough to visit the <br>
NWR during all 4 seasons and never stopped being thrilled by the <br>
abundance of birds in that area. <br>
<br>
The Canada Goose obviously has special significance to us.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you up our way sometime! The kids still talk about <br>
Kernville and the raft (and Sierra Sally's and mine almost <br>
unfortunate merging with the river lol!)<br>

I may replace it in the future, but it didn't seem right to keep the clue list at LBNA. I still have a listing at Atlas Quest for it indicating "retired". I think we really" gotcha" on your way home at A-Bear's letterbox.<br>

And I remember Erin and me reaching out to try and grab a hold of you <br>
two when we thought you and Sierra were being pitched out of the raft <br>
ahead of us. That was an incredible letterboxing moment. I hope you <br>
are doing well in Canada; after this last election, some of us wish <br>
we could join you (oops, sorry to bring politics into letterboxing). <br>
Thanks again for the great time in Kernville D&G!!<br>

 Well we could always vote for you to go, before we vote for you to <br>
stay.<br>
