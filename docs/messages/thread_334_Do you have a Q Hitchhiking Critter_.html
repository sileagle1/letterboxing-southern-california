I'm coming back to SoCal on Friday, so I won't be up north this <br>
weekend. But San Jose is pretty far north...it's likely to be picked <br>
up soon after you place it!  Yay! Go, Green Hornet, GO! Fly like the <br>
wind!<br>

All the people who helped move the Pink Pig to victory recieved a<br>
Really cute Postal Letterbox! I believe Q has other postal letterboxes<br>
for those Critters that come in Second and Third as well! (and maybe<br>
one for the last arrival, but that might be YEARS from now! :-)<br>
<br>
Anyway, it is worth your while to keep those critters moving! <br>
