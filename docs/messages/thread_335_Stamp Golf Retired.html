They were the only finders to complete the 8 holes. There are some folks that were only able to complete part of the game and they should have fractions listed in their "F" count. We aren't mentioning exactly who those finders may be, but if you polk around maybe you can figure it out. If you should jell and get into a jam, just throw a 1/2 nelson and Blast your way to the answer.<br>
