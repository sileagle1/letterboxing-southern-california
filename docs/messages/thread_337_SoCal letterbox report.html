<br>
The Birds of Kells was our first stop.<br>
#1 we believe is missing.<br>
#2 was last visited by a newletterboxer(we think). There was about 1/2 inch of water in the bottom, and the log was left out of the Ziploc. The log was drier than you are presently imagining.We used paper towels on the inside of the container, took a break and set everything in the sun. Now here is the coolest thing about #2 box, since it is right in the path of the landing planes you get to hear the whoosssh of the turbulence about 10 to 15 seconds after the big jets pass by. It is wild to hear the wind long after the jet has gone. Okay, we get jazzed by strange things these days.<br>
#3 was dry as a bone, and both stamps were beautifully carved.<br>
<br>
<br>
Corona del Mars<br>
There were several notes in this letterbox regarding the risk to life and limb, but we (I) were able to retrieve and replace without breaking my neck. I did end up with some sappy hands though. Boy I think back about the grief we got over  the Millard Falls incident(see Millard Falls note in clue sheet) and wonder what could be said to Ca. Bear. <br>
<br>
Don't change it Bear, it is a great hide and stamp.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tardis<br>
After waiting 10 minutes for the Tardis to become unoccupied, we retrieved the microbox without any problems. We walked down the street a ways, stamped in then walked back. This time the very same Tardis driver as before kept us waiting for 45 minutes before we could replant.<br>
<br>
Gwen & I are really glad to see the growth of letterboxing in SoCal. It is nice to have our pick of letterboxes to go search for, and be able to choose either those down the coast or those up in Pasadena areas when we come down to Seal Beach.<br>
