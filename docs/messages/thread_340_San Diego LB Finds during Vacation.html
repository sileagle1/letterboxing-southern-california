We did a handful of letterboxing in the San Diego area during our <br>
Thanksgiving vacation.  Our list includes:<br>
<br>
Olympic Rings<br>
Y - Last Man Standing<br>
Ski Beach Microbox<br>
Tea Time - with Big Bamboo HH<br>
UCSD Campus<br>
Dos Picos<br>
<br>
We were unable to find the Gliderport and Sandpiper boxes.  Not sure <br>
if they were missing or we missed them due to their microbox size.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the fun!<br>

PS. We also found time to plant one in Escondido and will be posting <br>
clues as soon as we get the premission form in to the park and <br>
approved.<br>

Woo hoo!  I'm in Escondido!  I recently moved here from Colorado and <br>
was disappointed to find that the other Escondido letterbox had gone <br>
missing.  How about that Tea Time box?  Great one, I think - <br>
wonderful view!  I also did the USCD series, and found the La Jolla <br>
box as well.<br>
<br>
Can't wait to see the Escondido clues -<br>

Rats! You found Y-Last Man Standing?! I searched high and low for <br>
that box and couldn't find it. I was positive it was missing. Well, <br>
better luck next time. At least I found the Solana Beach Stingray on <br>
that trip. One out of two is not bad for urban boxes.<br>

Permission? You ask permission to plant a box??!  What a novel idea. <br>
