Hello everyone. This is Ceci from Dos Locos.  I've just recently <br/>
moved to the oxnard area and don't really know anyone here.  Worst <br/>
off, i have no one to go letterboxing with.  The other half of <br/>
Dos Locos lives in San Luis Obispo so i can't go with him too much <br/>
anymore. Is there anyone living in Ventura county or even up to <br/>
Santa Barbara that would like to get together and do some <br/>
boxing?<br/>

Well Ceci if you could coax Ron(Critters of Ennisbrook) back into <br/>
the letterboxing world it would definately be a plus for <br/>
letterboxing. He hasn't been too active as I think he is in the <br/>
middle of a book project. You might use "contact the placer" on one <br/>
of his letterboxes in the area.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I think you guys had a box in Chalome that went missing? We <br/>
planted one across the road from Jack Ranch Cafe.<br/>

Yeah, we had a Box there but it disapeared.  We haven't replaced it and we haven't decided if we will quiet yet.  We don't drive that way much anymore now that I don't live in SLO i don't take the 46 to Bakersfield anymore.  Josh only goes that way to see my family and that's not very often.  So we'll see. I did scout a better hiding spot just incase. Maybe i will replant it when i go look for your new box.<br/>
