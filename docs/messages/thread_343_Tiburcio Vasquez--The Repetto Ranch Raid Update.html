I thought this 6-stamp series was such a good idea, and I carved more <br>
than decent stamps, but as far as I can tell, with one exception, no <br>
one has ever looked for them, even though they've been in place for 5 <br>
months! <br>
<br>
I had a report that my stamp #2 in the series had gone missing <br>
shortly after it was planted, but I just checked today and found it <br>
still in place! I always did think it was in a bad location though, <br>
so I moved it to a slightly better, but still not that great location <br>
nearby. (Just couldn't find a good spot near here, and it has to be <br>
here for historical reasons.) I also checked on my last box in the <br>
series which is planted in West Hollywood at the spot where <br>
Vasquez was eventually captured, and there was not a single stamp in <br>
the book. Heavy sigh....  I mean Q, this stamp is within spitting <br>
distance of your stamps (the worst carving, though)!<br>
<br>
The stamps in this series are placed along the route of 19th century <br>
California's most famous bandito's final raid, from the location of <br>
the hold-up through the escape route, as he was being hotly pursued <br>
by a sheriff's posse, eventually eluding the sheriff in the San <br>
Gabriel mountains to the north.<br>

Buzzard, I found box #1 and the carving was great! I was also the one <br>
unable to find box #2. I have every intention of pursuing the <br>
others... one of these days. This series saved the lives of the four <br>
kittens I found abandoned in a box on a hot day at #1, though :)<br>

Hi Q!,<br>
I had forgotten that you found #1 and saved the kittens, but that and <br>
your report of #2 being missing was the only feedback I ever got on <br>
this series. I was sure you were right about #2 being missing, 'cos <br>
it was a pretty lousy place to hide a box, what with all that <br>
exposure. I drove a couple of blocks down from the Disney Hall today <br>
just to confirm that #2 was indeed missing, and I found a bottle of <br>
ethyl alcohol buried underneath the shrubbery at the LB location. The <br>
rock marking the location of the LB was gone, but I dug my gloved <br>
hand around the spot and was astonished to find it under an inch of <br>
dirt. As you can now see from the re-written clues on <br>
letterboxing.org, I re-hid it at a different, but probably not much <br>
better spot nearby. If you find a better hiding spot in that block, <br>
I'll move the LB and credit this as a co-planted box.<br>

  OK-- Save the alcohol, Gwen & I are headed to Seal Beach the middle of Jan through middle of Feb.<br>
  The Repetto Ranch series are high on our list.Did you see the reference I made to the series on our Coyote Hole Stage Robbery?<br>

Don,<br>
I hadn't checked out the clues to your Coyote Hole Stage Robbery; <br>
thanks for the free publicity. At the time your clues were posted, I <br>
hadn't ever driven on HWY 14 and 178; now I've driven them so much in <br>
recent months I know exactly where these LBs are hidden. I've got to <br>
take a road trip back out on HWY 14; there's so many letterboxes <br>
hidden along that route. Ryan should include these HWYs in his cool <br>
trip planner on Atlas Quest. <br>
