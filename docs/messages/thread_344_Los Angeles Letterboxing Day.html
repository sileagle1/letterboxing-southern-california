Today I drove down the hill from Pasadena to the fair city of the <br>
angels. First stop was the "Walt Disney Concert Hall" letterbox. This <br>
building is very strange and beautiful.  And as opposed to 20th <br>
century buildings, there's about a million great places on it to hide <br>
a letterbox. This was my first visit, though I'd driven by it before. <br>
I had to circumambulate the building, and basically crawl all over it <br>
to find the box, so I got a great tour. While searching for the LB, I <br>
stumbled upon a geocache also hidden at the building site.  I fear <br>
one day this letterbox will be mistaken for the geocache, and the <br>
stamp taken as a trade item. Fortunately for me, I had a brand new <br>
colorbox silver ink pad, which was perfect for this stamp.<br>
<br>
Next stop was the Hollywood Hills to find "To the Bat Cave," planted <br>
by Q. This stamp and its location is way cool! The stamp is planted <br>
at the cave used in the Batman television series as the spot where <br>
the Batmobile zooms out of the Batcave. The stamp is fantastic, as is <br>
the "Oof" stamp planted nearby. I was about the eighth stamp in the <br>
books. Great job Q!<br>
<br>
And being that this is Hollywood, while walking down the canyon from <br>
Q's boxes, I ran into Jack LaLanne shooting an infomercial about his <br>
juicer<br>

Nancy and I found the To The BatCave letterboxes about a month ago <br>
(11/14) and while we we there, they were actually filming in the <br>
cave.  They were doing a film about 1930s chinese discovering alien <br>
artifacts - to air sometime on the History Channel.  It looked very <br>
low budget.  We were able to walk around back, and snag the box <br>
without being caught.  We then spent a good 3 hours searching for "A <br>
Bridge Too Fingerprinted", but never found the correct area.<br>
<br>
We also found Tiburcio Vasquez #3 and #4 a few weeks before (10/23), <br>
and plan to go back for the rest after the holidays.<br>

Hi Lee & Nancy,<br>
How are you guys doing? I notice you've been busy planting <br>
letterboxes; I'll have to take a road trip up there one of these days <br>
while the weather is cool and have a hi-desert stamp-in.<br>
<br>
I'm glad to hear you found my Vasquez #3 & #4. Moderndulcinea found <br>
my #1, so that leaves #2, #5, and #6 that haven't been found (can't <br>
personally vouch for #5, but it is the most difficult to get to).<br>
<br>
I found Hamish Macbeth et al's "Passport to the Falls" letterbox on <br>
4/26/03, which was planted on the same day as the "Bridge Too <br>
Fingerprinted" box, but then searched in vain for this second box as <br>
well. I suspect it's just further along the Angeles Crest HWY than I <br>
was prepared to travel at the time (Big Horn Sheep country is pretty <br>
high up).<br>
<br>
I noticed your stamp in the "To The Batcave" LB; you all seem to get <br>
down here a lot. I just planted two new LBs and will soon post the <br>
clues on Atlas Quest. I hope to see you at this Northern <br>
California Gathering in April that I've heard tell about. It'll be a <br>
long drive for me, but much longer for you. I kick myself bi-daily <br>
for missing the last San Francisco Gathering, but it was announced <br>
without enough lead time for me to put together an S.F. trip. There <br>
were some illustrious LBers at that gathering that I would have liked <br>
to have seen again.<br>
