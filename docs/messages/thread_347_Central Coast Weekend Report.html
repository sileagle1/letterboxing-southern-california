Worked like a crazy woman with a dim flashlight at 8pm but was the <br/>
first to find The Little Bastard Thursday night.  We must all think <br/>
the same cause I keep thinking that I'll put one there too... (As a <br/>
cattle person, I hope you all remember to shut the gate on the way <br/>
in and on the way out!)<br/>
<br/>
Fixed up the Mission San Luis Obispo stamp so it's usable again<br/>
<br/>
Found The Other Building and December 26th in SLO and visited <br/>
Jugglermouse too (The Other Building is very cool!) FINALLY found <br/>
the Walking Tour stamp after 4 trips to SLO! Good one Ryan! That one <br/>
made us work!<br/>
<br/>
Found Box one of St. Patricks Flyer but darkness prevented us from <br/>
getting box two or Flutter.<br/>
<br/>
Found Can o Spam in plain sight from our car... tried to hide it a <br/>
little better. <br/>
<br/>
Looked for Nature Box in Avila but couldn't find the trail.. <br/>
<br/>
Ryan.. the stamp is missing from the bookstore box. Logbook is there <br/>
but no stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Had a great time.... Thanks to everybody who planted!<br/>

Thanks for the first finder info. FYI Ryan doesn't get mail from this list, he signed up no email. Sir B and Juggler Mouse don't get this list either. I'm not sure about other authors. You might want to cross post on NorCal list.<br/>

&gt; Ryan.. the stamp is missing from the bookstore box. Logbook is there <br/>
&gt; but no stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I've gotten reports about this starting a couple of months ago, and<br/>
updated Atlas Quest to show it needs some 'maintenance'.  I e-mailed<br/>
Juggler Mouse asking if she could check it out for me, but never heard<br/>
back.  =(  I'll definitely be replacing it when I go down there for<br/>
Christmas, though.  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; FYI Ryan doesn't get mail from this list, he<br/>
&gt; signed up no email. <br/>
<br/>
No, I don't get mail, but I do occasionally pop in to see what's going<br/>
on.  =)  I don't want to fall out of the loop!<br/>
