I edited the clues to remind folks to shut the gate behind them. Did you like the container? I have been a little concerned about using it on a ground level plant, as someone might think that it is a land mine. Thanks for your input.<br>

Thanks for the note about the placers and cross posting.. good to <br>
know.<br>
<br>
I thought the box was great!.. I couldn't see it very well, but I <br>
think it would be ok on the ground. Course I've never seen a land <br>
mine, so maybe I'm not a good judge for this question. <br>
<br>
Very cool stamp! I like what you made for the stamp. I could never <br>
settle on what to make the stamp for that location, but that stamp <br>
is perfect. <br>
<br>
The weird part of my experience looking for that box.... I was on <br>
the side of the road looking and looking. A trucker pulled over and <br>
I thought he'd seen me with my flashlight. So just as I was going to <br>
say hello or something, he started relieving himself on the side of <br>
the road.. It was too dark to tell what he was doing before that, <br>
but I couldn't have been more than 10 ft away.  So I just turned <br>
around and got behind a tree so that I didn't startle him... Boy I <br>
could have scared the H E double toothpicks out of him! <br>
