Hi Everyone!<br>
<br>
I took a trip to San Diego yesterday and saw some of the most <br>
beautiful places that I have ever seen thanks to letterboxing! <br>
<br>
The first box we went to was the Batiquitos Lagoon letterbox.  I had <br>
often seen this place from the I-5, but never really knew what it  <br>
was! This was a great box due to the glimpse of history that it <br>
showed me of LB'ing (and geocaching) in S. California. The swing was <br>
fun too! Thanks Buzzard for having adopted this one!<br>
<br>
Then it was off to the Solana Beach Stingray Microbox, which I <br>
couldn't find.  Boohoo! I had a hard time following the clues even <br>
though they seemed very straightforward.  I'll have to try it again <br>
some other time.  Anyone got some pointers?<br>
<br>
Next was La Jolla LB, which was a beautiful place right off the <br>
coast.  The sun was beginning to go down, so the contrast of the <br>
golden cliffs against the vivid blue ocean was remarkable.  There <br>
was some foot traffic there but we managed to be insconspicuous.  <br>
I'll admit, though, that it took some waiting for the traffic to <br>
clear!<br>
<br>
We tried squeezing in one last box for the day... the Tea Time <br>
Letterbox.  Boy, what a perfect way to end the day!! This location <br>
is probably the most beautiful place I've seen so far in SD! Lots of <br>
greenery, spectacular view of the ocean, and by far the biggest <br>
mansion I have ever seen! I imagine that's what the Gatsby mansion <br>
would look like if it existed! We stamped in and watched the sunset <br>
("We" meaning my boyfriend and I... I drag him along on these LBing <br>
gigs with me).  <br>
<br>
Been to San Diego a lot, but never knew these places exsited! <br>
Overall a very pleasant and fruitful day in San Diego.  Where else <br>
can you find 75-degree weather in the middle of December?<br>

We loved that letterbox what a beautiful view. I had to laugh though, we didn't expect to find it where it was, it took a little hunting on the kids part. <br>
