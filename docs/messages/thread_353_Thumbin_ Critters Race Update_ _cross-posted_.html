Sorry for the cross-post...<br>
<br>
I know it is cold and unboxable in many areas right now, but a few of <br>
the racers have made it to the East coast, and I thought it warranted <br>
an update!<br>
<br>
Many of you know that Pink Pig won the race a few months back and the <br>
Gold Trophy PLB prize has made the rounds to those that carried her <br>
to victory. But there is still the Silver Cup PLB for second place <br>
and the Bronze Medal PLB for third to be awarded! As well as a few <br>
other prizes that you can read all about on the race blog...<br>
<br>
On to the updates:<br>
<br>
Tan Dog was last known to be chewing sticks at the Coccinellidae <br>
letterbox in Wofford Heights, CA...<br>
<br>
Green Hornet was last known to be buzzing in the Rancho San Antonio <br>
Series: Quirky Quail letterbox in Cupertino, CA...<br>
<br>
Purple Turtle was last known to be hibernating at the Rock Camp <br>
letterbox in Lake Arrowhead, CA...<br>
<br>
Black Bat was just dropped off today at the Leap Frog letterbox in <br>
Mountville, PA...<br>
<br>
Blue Cat is in the arms of a letterboxer somewhere in Georgia and <br>
should be dropped off soon...<br>
<br>
Grey Owl is in the arms of a letterboxer somewhere in Rhode Island <br>
and should be dropped off soon...<br>
<br>
Orange Octopus and Yellow Kangaroo were picked up by letterboxers but <br>
have not sent word in a long time - anyone have any info to share?<br>
<br>
Red Bull - poor Red Bull - is confirmed to be gone from his starting <br>
box, but has never been heard from... Anyone else suspect foul play?<br>
<br>
And where in the world is Rosie Ruiz??? Haven't heard of her <br>
whereabouts in quite some time...<br>
<br>
Well, that's all folks! To keep updated on the racers' progress and <br>

  On to the updates:<br>
<br>
  Tan Dog was last known to be chewing sticks at the Coccinellidae <br>
  letterbox in Wofford Heights, CA...<br>
<br>
  It is probably covered in 3 feet of snow, but spring is only a few months away, and the Coccinellidae will be out frolicking.<br>

So Okay,<br>
I knew I wasn't exactly planting Tan Dog at letterboxing central when <br>
I left the pup at Coccinellidae, but Coccinellidae is such a <br>
wonderful letterbox that I think it's a great place for the little <br>
greyhound to hibernate through the winter.<br>
<br>
Q didn't create an award for the LAST of her HHs to hit NYC. Imagine, <br>
it's five or ten years hence, and through all the tribulations little <br>
Tan Dog finally reaches the box in NYC, last place, and who will be <br>
there to rejoice???<br>
--Buzzard<br>
P.S.  It's just like "Paddle Me To The Sea."<br>

Actually, there is an award in case all ten critters cross the <br>
finish line, called the Loser Stamp, which I promise to be worth the <br>
national effort of getting them all there! It will be available to <br>
EVERYONE who took part in the race, so hopefully the ones that <br>
haven't surfaced since the race started will show up eventually :)  -<br>
