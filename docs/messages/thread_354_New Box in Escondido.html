We have finally published the clues for the box we planted in <br>
Escondido during our Thanksgiving visit.  Took us a while to get the <br>
form to the park rangers and we still haven't heard back from them.  <br>
The box is called the Vacation Series - CA (you can find it on <br>
either LBNA or AQ).  If there is an area boxer that is interested in <br>
helping us maintain it, we would appreciate it.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the CA boxes during our visit, hope you like our <br>
addition.<br>
