Hi All,<br>
<br>
Target in Pasadena, near Madre, had two sizes of hand made, unlined<br>
books in their 1 dollar section. The larger is 7x5" for $1 and the<br>
smaller is 3 1/2 x 4", 2 for a $1.  The covers are colored heavy<br>
cardstock and the pages are a nice weight white paper.<br>
<br>
They also had aluminum, telescoping walking sticks on sale for $5. <br>
Great for the kids...<br>
<br>
Should I post this kind of information on the new BoxHeads List<br>
instead of here?<br>

Since I was the person that commented on the "Sales promo" on the main list, I'll give you my two cents. Your info post doesn't bother me at all. When the party on the main list posted a t-shirt for Christmas pitch it was a direct pitch for a small apparel company. If you check the archives I doubt that you will find any previous posts from that sender. I thought it was a pretty blatant misuse of the main list, particularly if others, such as Silent Doug, and Randy Hall never push their stuff on our chat lists. Frankly Doug's t-shirts look a heck of a lot better. Ca. Bear is the owner of this list and he hasn't given me much info for moderation so it would be his decision. This is more of a SoCal info for log books, but it wouldn't hurt to cross post to Boxheads. Hopefully this will not start a problematic discussion here.<br>
