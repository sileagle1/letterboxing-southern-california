Well been wondering how all my southern Cal letterboxing friends are <br>
doing with all this wet weather? I imagine Don and Gwen have plenty <br>
of the white stuff. Buzzard... hope everything is ok with you and <br>
your wife and your home.  <br>

Hope everybody's OK<br>

We have had quite a bit of weather, but the snow has been melting off at our house. We're heading to Seal Beach tomorrow, that is if the pass is open.<br>

Hi Sierra!<br>
We've had a couple of minor roof leaks, but considering the deluge, <br>
we turned out okay.  Thanks for asking. I can't imagine the <br>
condition of my Eaton Canyon Boxes, though.  I walked up to the <br>
canyon a couple of days ago, and the normally dry creek bed had <br>
turned into a hundred foot wide river with Class 5 rapids (I'll try <br>
and post a photo; never done that before). I've never seen anything <br>
like it in the canyon. It'll be fun to check out the changes this <br>
weekend, if the weather stays dry.<br>

The Kern got up to about 9000 CFS when the warm rains came in. For perspective you guys saw it about 850 CFS. It looks like it will be a big water year, which could mean more boating and less boxes.<br>

Wow, that must have been a site. The last time I saw the Kern River <br>
was in late October, and I was standing high above it on the roof of <br>
Kern River #3. Those hydroelectric operators have a great "smoking <br>
break" view.<br>
<br>
The river will be so high that all those rapids will be covered and <br>
folks will be out yachting.<br>
