I was just driving by Solvang and Buellton, CA the other day! I am <br/>
bummed that I did not stop at any of the "Sideways" spots. I have <br/>
been waiting for an Ostrichland letterbox (maybe I should be the one <br/>
to place it??!!) Here is the article from USAToday about this area:<br/>

'Sideways' fans go for taste of wine country <br/>
By Kitty Bean Yancey, USA TODAY<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Room 234 at the Days Inn at the Windmill in Buellton, Calif., may <br/>
look like nothing more than a typical roadside rest stop  two beds, <br/>
TV, not fancy. But now it's a tourist attraction.<br/>
<br/>
The actors who play two pinot-swigging road trippers in Sideways <br/>
filmed motel scenes in the room, which rents for $69 a night and up. <br/>
Since the little movie's big success, "people come stay just because <br/>
we're in it," front desk manager Vera Villalobos says. "Some come <br/>
just to take pictures."<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the film  the most-nominated at this Sunday's Golden Globe <br/>
Awards and viewed as an Oscar contender as well  has uncorked a <br/>
tourism swell in the Santa Ynez Valley, about 130 miles north of Los <br/>
Angeles and a 45-minute drive north of Santa Barbara.<br/>
<br/>
At the Sanford Winery, where wine snob Miles (Paul Giamatti) opines <br/>
in Sideways about a sample's strawberry/asparagus/Edam overtones, <br/>
tasting-room manager Chris Burroughs (the long-haired, cowboy-hatted <br/>
dude seen patiently putting up with Miles and oafish pal Jack in the <br/>
movie) is hosting a stream of visitors. Some even changed vacation <br/>
plans and made a detour after seeing Sideways, he says. "It's great <br/>
for business."<br/>
<br/>
And that Sanford vin gris that Miles evaluates in the movie (it's <br/>
just a fancy name for ros, by the way) has sold out.<br/>
<br/>
In Buellton, the busy Hitching Post II restaurant  a real-life local <br/>
hangout where Miles drowns his sorrows and falls for a waitress  is <br/>
even busier. Sideways T-shirts ($14) are now on the menu there.<br/>
<br/>
"Our wine country is a star of the film  we couldn't have asked for <br/>
better PR," says Shannon Brooks of the Santa Barbara Conference &amp; <br/>
Visitors Bureau. It's building on the buzz with "Sideways, The Map," <br/>
a self-guided tour map spotlighting 18 film locations, including <br/>
wineries, eateries and Ostrich Land. It's free at 800-676-1266 or <br/>
santabarbaraca.com.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox Searchlight studio, distributor of Sideways, has collaborated <br/>
on a whimsical 48-page guide to locations, plus wine tips and movie <br/>
dialogue. Published by Newmarket Press, it's sold at some film <br/>
locales (including the Hitching Post, where it costs $6) and may be <br/>
coming to bookstores soon.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Santa Barbara-based Personal Tours Ltd. is offering <br/>
customized Sideways guided outings. One stop might be the <br/>
film's "Frass Canyon" winery, where Miles goes berserk after finding <br/>
out the book he has poured his soul into won't be published. In real <br/>
life, the vineyard is the Fess Parker Winery, owned by the Daniel <br/>
Boone and Davy Crockett star. <br/>
<br/>
Because of the film, "the wine country  which has been up and <br/>
coming  is really getting attention," says Personal Tours Ltd. <br/>
director David Echols.<br/>
<br/>
"For the Sideways tours, most of the people are not (wine) <br/>
professionals. They just want to relive the fun of that movie."<br/>
