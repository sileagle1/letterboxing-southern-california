                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday, I took Autumn from Colorado for a letterboxing excursion SoCal style.<br>
 She was stunned by the density and ease of the two series that we retrieved. <br>
She used to boxes that are hours apart and require hiking to get to.  Her<br>
husband called while we were stamping into one of the boxes and she excitedly<br>
told him that she was WALKING, not hiking to boxes and was sitting at a table<br>
while stamping in.<br>
<br>
We found all three of the Strange Stamp series and 6 of the 7 El Dorado Park<br>
series (the Nature Center was closed by the time we got over that way).  We also<br>
dropped off a hitchhiker in one of the nine boxes we found.  :)<br>
<br>
I have to say if is kind of hard to be subtle and inconspicous while retrieving<br>
Strange Stamp #2 but it is definately worth it!<br>

 How many folks have stamped in at the ? box?  Incidentally we think we have figured out the Golf Stamp series and will have to find some time in Oct. to get back to Long Beach. This may rival our Seal Beach series. Don<br>

The Omar Sharif clue threw Autumn off but I was able to give her a little<br>
push in the right direction and she figured it out.<br>
