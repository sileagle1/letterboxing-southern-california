                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just checked on Pt Vicente Lighthouse, replaced El Dorado #1(Nature Center), verified that Elvis is alive, and Billie Boswell is still biking. The Mystery box is long gone. It was possibly washed away. The view at the box location for Pt. Vicente was tremendous. Catalina looked like you could reach out and touch it, and two other channel islands could be seen.<br>
