I finished checking on all my boxes today since the rains and here's <br>
a little report.<br>
<br>
The Morbid Tour:<br>
<br>
The Janis Box is alive and well.<br>
The John Box is still missing.<br>
The River Box is confirmed missing.<br>
The Sharon Box, despite a missing report months ago, is alive and <br>
well!<br>
<br>
The Data Recovery Mission:<br>
<br>
#2 & #3 were missing.<br>
<br>
#8 was destroyed by water and removed for maintenance.<br>
<br>
All others were alive and well, but not worth hunting until the other <br>
three are back in commission.<br>
<br>
The Morbid Tour #2:<br>
<br>
The Jack Box was reported to be alive and well on 1/6/05 by another <br>
letterboxer.<br>
<br>
Bye Bye Kitty is alive and well.<br>
<br>
To the Batcave! is either buried too deeply under a mudslide for me <br>
to find, or washed away.<br>
<br>
Oof! is alive and well.<br>
<br>
Hollywoof Kennel was alive and well, and I left a new hitchhiker with <br>
it that I received in a PLB from the east coast - fun to look at the <br>
variety of signature stamps from the other side of the country...<br>
<br>
I hope to get all my missing and damaged boxes back and planted <br>
within a month or so.  -Q<br>
