Hi Gerwaiian Oma,<br>
It's great to find out about new boxers in SoCal. I know Sierra Sally <br>
will tell you all about the Sacramento Event planned for the end of <br>
April, but what she might not tell you is that in order to attend the <br>
event, you must have planted at least three letterboxes within the <br>
city limits of Pasadena. I'm surprised Sierra didn't mention this in <br>
her first posts, but she assumed we all knew the rules. Good luck on <br>
those Pasadena plants, and I'll be seeing you in Sacramento!<br>

Hey Buzzard,<br>
If you had finished the Seal Beach Town Tour, Pub Crawl, and Surf <br>
Fishing then you would be aware of G O. and the rest of their boxing <br>
crew. They also planted one at my old surfing spot(many moons ago, <br>
600 or so)Ray Bay. You never gave me an answer on Millard Falls-- Do <br>
you want to adopt? It is the only one we have in your neighborhood.<br>

Gerwaiian Oma,<br>
Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It's not true. I just wanted you to plant some <br>
letterboxes near my house in Pasadena. You don't have to do that to <br>
go to the Sacramento event. <br>
<br>
Are you happy Don? I said I was sorry. <br>
<br>
And Don, it would be an honor to adopt Millard Falls, my ninth found <br>
letterbox on 3/29/03. (I must have had too much of that Vanilla Coke <br>
and Vodka when you asked me before.) <br>
--Buzzard (the droopy bad bird)<br>
<br>
P.S. Gerwaiian Oma, you really should plant some boxes in Pasadena; <br>
it's a nice town. Check out that Old Town on a Saturday night, it's  <br>
crowded like Sunset Boulevard--action, baby!<br>
