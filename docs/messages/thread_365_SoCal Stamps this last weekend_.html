All the trails in the San Gabriel Mountains are basically closed for <br>
hiking because of rain damage, so that left me with no other option <br>
but to letterbox this last Saturday and Sunday.  Saturday I found <br>
the "Horse Thief Canyon" Series in San Dimas. Those turkeys Lee &<br>
Nancy beat me to first stamp the Saturday before. How dare they <br>
descend to the lowlands to grab up our rightful boxes! I loved the <br>
cryptogram clues to this series (which took me a full week longer <br>
than Lee & Nancy to decipher).<br>
<br>
On Sunday, it was off to Mission San Fernando de Espana for a <br>
letterbox planted by . . . can you guess . . . wait for it:  SIERRA <br>
SALLY!  I'm getting quite the California Mission education based<br>
on Sierra's signature series.  Of course, in this case, I<br>
didn't have to pay the $5 to tour the mission first, which did <br>
somewhat detract from the educational experience of my visit (it was <br>
pretty from the outside, though). Thanks for the great stamp, Sierra! <br>
<br>
Then I had to leave the mission and speed off after the "E.T.<br>
Phone Home" letterbox in Northridge, planted by geishagirl. This<br>
letterbox is planted in a park that was used in the filming of the <br>
movie, and has some great views of the foothills.  <br>
<br>
After E.T., my well-planned itinerary took me to Cal State Northridge <br>
in search of the "CSUN Botanical Gardens" letterbox planted by Parrot <br>
Head jmo.  Alas, perhaps because it is during winter break, the <br>
gardens were closed; locked up tight; even though they are normally <br>
open on Sundays. I contemplated breaking in, but though the fence was <br>
low, it consisted of close-set, medieval-looking spikes, and I had <br>
visions of Vlad the Impaler, so I decided to wait for spring term.  <br>
<br>
Four great stamps in two days is a windfall here in SoCal, so I had a <br>
great time.<br>
