Eaton Canyon in Altadena took a tremendous beating from the winter <br>
rains. Of the Other Canyons letterbox series, I've confirmed that <br>
the "Meadow Letterbox" has definitely been washed away. I haven't <br>
checked on the others as yet, but the trail to the "Walnut Canyon" <br>
LB is currently closed. I also removed the Eaton Canyon Letterbox <br>
because the stampbook was completely soaked. I'll replace this and <br>
the Meadow LB soon.<br>
