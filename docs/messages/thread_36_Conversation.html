I think it is a great idea.  I look forward to the day when one of them will<br>
show up in my mailbox.<br>
<br>
I know some people are a little freaked by the idea of someone having their<br>
address but it doesn't bother me.  Then again, I am a male.  If I was a female<br>
who lived alone, I might be a little iffy about giving out my address to people<br>
who are pracitcally strangers.<br>
<br>
BTW:  I am sorry for neglecting my own group.  <sigh>  I have been sick for a<br>
bit now and have pretty much been going home from work and going to bed without<br>
checking my e-mail.  I checked this morning and found that I have over 300<br>
unread in the LBNA group.  It seems I missed some opportunities to be on some<br>
snail mail lists.  : (<br>
<br>
Tonight, I think I am feeling well enough to make some more stamps for my<br>
pending trip to No. Cal. and Oregon!  I have about 9 carved already for a series<br>
I plan to place along the Umpqua river in Oregon.  That particular area (around<br>
Crater Lake) is a bit thin with only two boxes.<br>
<br>
I am also planning to put some around the Lava Beds National Monument.  Some of<br>
the place names there just scream out for letterboxes: Skull Cave, Valentine<br>
Cave, Captain Jack's Stronghold...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lava Beds National Monument is totally bitchin'.  My brother and I <br>
got lost in a cave there when we were about 10, and had only a small <br>
flashlight to guide us; my brother got upset 'cos he was behind me <br>
and couldn't really see the tiny ray of light--he cried--cool!  P.S. <br>
We escaped with our lives.<br>

group so they will update the HH site. Thanks.<br>
