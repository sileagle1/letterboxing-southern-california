Hi All!!<br>
<br>
Allow me to tell you about my love for letterboxing or in this<br>
case, <br>
letterboxing for my love (this sounds so cryptic, but it will all <br>
become very clear to you by the end of this story).<br>
<br>
Last Friday, 2/11, I got a message through the LbNA website from a <br>
new letterboxer named "StevieFranklin2005" in regards to my<br>
Wooly's <br>
LB.   The message was as follows:<br>
<br>
"If I find your Wooly Letterbox on Saturday (2/12/2005), I will<br>
place <br>
a hitchhiker stamp in it! I hope I understand your clues.  PLEASE <br>
look for my stamp on Sunday; I am quite proud of it."<br>
<br>
I haven't been doing this LB'ing thing for very long, but the<br>
email <br>
did seem to be a little outside of conventional LB'ing protocol.  <br>
I've always viewed HH's as little surprises, and here this<br>
guy was, <br>
declaring to me that upon the discovery of one of my boxes, he was <br>
going to triumphantly plant a HH there to show his conquest.  I was a <br>
little amused by the fact that this person was so enthusiastic about <br>
planting a HH, he absolutely HAD to tell me about it and ruin the <br>
surprise.  I attributed this behavior to the possibility that he was <br>
so new at this that he didn't know any better.  <br>
<br>
Anyhow, I emailed him back and told him that I was sure it looked <br>
very nice and that I looked forward to seeing it.<br>
<br>
I told my boyfriend about it that night, and we both chuckled.  My <br>
boyfriend is not as interested in LB'ing as I am.  He doesn't<br>
care <br>
much for carving stamps and hiding them, but he does enjoy finding <br>
the stamps with me, as well as the places it takes us to.  He <br>
suggested that we should check it out when we had a chance.  Seeing <br>
that he actually was up for some minor letterboxing, how could I <br>
refuse?<br>
<br>
So Sunday, 2/13 rolled around.  Since it was Valentine's Day<br>
weekend, <br>
he had made dinner reservations for us at a nice local restaurant for <br>
7:30.  We had spent that morning running a 5K in Chinatown, and then <br>
afterward stayed there for the Chinese New Year festivities.  By the <br>
time we got home in the afternoon, we were bushed, so we took a nap, <br>
and he woke us up at around 6PM and said we should get ready to go <br>
out.  Now, my boyfriend is typically not a very punctual person, so I <br>
was impressed that he wanted to get up a little earlier so we would <br>
have some time to go look for the HH and still make it to the <br>
restaurant in time.  I figured he thought I would enjoy stamping the <br>
HH in my logbook.<br>
<br>
It was pretty much dark when we got to Wooly's hiding spot. <br>
I'd <br>
never really been there at night, and was surprised to find that the <br>
location is pretty well lit, with a warm yellowish light emanating <br>
from the streetlight.  We retrieved the box and I sat on a bench and <br>
opened it.  I saw the HH wrapped in a napkin sitting in a little <br>
baggie.  The first thing I noticed was that the HH didn't have<br>
its <br>
own logbook.  I looked in my Wooly's logbook and saw that C-Bear<br>
and <br>
Koko had been there that day and stamped in, but no HH imprint!! I <br>
couldn't help but think that StevieFranklin2005 definitely was<br>
new at <br>
this, and that he should have at least looked up how to create a HH <br>
somewhere online.  "Well, I'll just look at the stamp itself,<br>
then," <br>
I thought to myself.  I took it out of the bag and unwrapped it.  It <br>
wasn't as impressive as StevieFranklin2005 had described it to<br>
be. It <br>
only had a few words and some hearts carved into it.  I kind of <br>
figured out what the words said and found that it was a<br>
Valentine's <br>
Day themed HH!!  I was beginning to think what an interesting idea it <br>
was to place a themed HH in my box, when I heard my boyfriend ask <br>
me, "So what does it say?"  I looked up and saw him busily<br>
kneeling <br>
down tying his shoe.  <br>
<br>
"It's funny," I said, "It says `Will You Marry<br>
Me?'"<br>
<br>
"Well, will you?"<br>
<br>
I looked up at him again, somewhat confused.  There he was, kneeling <br>
in front of me, with a little box in his hands.  I was totally <br>
floored!!! The ring was beautiful!  And OF COURSE I SAID YES!!!<br>
<br>
The funny thing is, as my mind was swimming around in all the <br>
excitement, I was still confused, and wondered where <br>
StevieFranklin2005's HH was.  In case you hadn't figured it<br>
out by <br>
now (like me), it turned out my boyfriend, now "fiance,"<br>
had made it <br>
all up!!  I had no idea he could be so creative.<br>
<br>
Today I got an email from C-Bear and Koko telling me they had found <br>
my box and that there was a personal stamp in there for me.  I found <br>
that hilarious!  Thanks to the two of you for not having mistaken the <br>
stamp for a real HH, and for contributing to the best moment of my <br>
life!!!<br>
<br>
I have always been appreciative of the places that LB'ing has<br>
taken <br>
me to, but never did I imagine that it would take me here!!!<br>
<br>
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY EVERYONE!!!!! <br>
