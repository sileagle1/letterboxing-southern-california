Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Just an Pacific Northwesterner traveling through the San Diego <br/>
region for a few days and wanted to post a note about boxes we'd <br/>
recently found:<br/>
<br/>
We found the Joachin Murieta Outlaw, Tule Elk and San Juan <br/>
Capistrano Letterboxes all alive &amp; well on 16 Feb 05.<br/>
<br/>
Today, we unsuccessfully attempted the Solana Beach Stingray but did <br/>
manage to find San Diego Sails, Gliderport, Tea Time &amp; La Jolla <br/>
Letterboxes all very much alive &amp; well with many visitors.  Not sure <br/>
where we went wrong with the Stingray but since we'll be in the area <br/>
a few more days we may reattempt it with any helpful hints folks <br/>
might be able to provide us.  The boxes all provided us with such an <br/>
incredible vacation as the clues were great, the stamps incredible <br/>
and the vistas simply breathtaking!!!  We took with us a Newbie <br/>
today to whom we were introducing this great hobby and she was <br/>
thoroughly impressed with the experience.  Perhaps we'll have a new <br/>
convert in our midst???  Oh, we must've just passed by another <br/>
letterboxer at the Tea Time box--this individual was visiting from <br/>
Tampa, FL--how neat would that have been to exchange signature <br/>
stamps along the trail between visitors who both hail from such <br/>
distant places???  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for some great boxes.  We'll be in the area a few more days <br/>
and will attempt a couple more along the way.  If anybody is <br/>
interested in linking up for a quick exchange, drop us a line and we <br/>
can try to link up somewhere.  We're staying on North Island but <br/>
plan to drive all around the area for various treks.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

It's great to have such illustrious LBers down in SoCal. Too bad your <br/>
visit coincides with these torrential rains; this is definitely not <br/>
the norm for us. I've already confirmed that one of my Pasadena <br/>
letterboxes was literally washed away in a flood, and am none to sure <br/>
about the status of a few others. Being from the Northwest, perhaps <br/>
you're use to this kind of weather.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a little hint for the Solana Beach Stingray: the clues <br/>
say "return to the restrooms"; remember, this box was planted by <br/>
HummerLady, so this should clue you in on where at the restrooms to <br/>
start your search.<br/>
<br/>
When planning your next trip down to SoCal, keep in mind that there <br/>
are 50 letterboxes hidden within a few squares miles around the <br/>
Pasadena area (it's like "Little Connecticut" around here), and 150 <br/>
in Los Angeles County. <br/>

&gt; Too bad your visit coincides with these torrential rains<br/>
<br/>
And you know, the biggest irony of it all is that the weather is<br/>
absolutely WONDERFUL here in the Pacific Northwest!  I could see from<br/>
Mount Baker all the down to Mount Rainier without even squinting.<br/>
<br/>
I've never seen such a beautiful February in the Pacific Northwest<br/>
since I moved here!  It's like summer--but colder.  =)<br/>

Thanks for the heads up.  Hey, we tried another SoCal letterbox <br/>
today--this time the Sandpiper LB down in Chula Vista and I'm fairly <br/>
convinced that it did float away as the bush the clues led us to was <br/>
under about a foot of muddy, gross water.  I looked all around for <br/>
man-made floating objects and the only thing I could find was a <br/>
Pepsi can.  We had a great visit at the center, though, so that more <br/>
than made up for the lack of a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, isn't it just our luck that the weather back home is GORGEOUS <br/>
and we're down here hanging out on the beach in jeans, fleece <br/>
sweatshirts, Tevas &amp; Goretex coats???  That's the norm for my life!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, it's beautiful nonetheless.  Rain doesn't intimidate us--<br/>
hey, we got a deluge in Tijuana today--so much so that the police <br/>
shut down many of the streets because they flooded so severely!  <br/>
Just another adventure...<br/>

Buzzard--Thanks for the hint about the stingray.  I tried a bunch of <br/>
different possibilities but never stumbled on the box--I did manage <br/>
to find a couple other 'microboxes' despite the flooding.  Hey, <br/>
about the many letterboxes up your way, I spent around $50 at kinkos <br/>
printing up many of the clues to boxes in this area--that was <br/>
printing two pages of clues per one sheet of paper even!  I can't <br/>
imagine how much it would have been had I printed ALL of the clues <br/>
to California Letterboxes (even though we'd already found a bunch of <br/>
them)--this state's LB population has truly exploded exponentially <br/>
since the last time we visited!!!<br/>
<br/>
Back to braving the deluge, tornados and flooding today!  ;)  To <br/>
think it's absolutely gorgeous back home!!! But then again, we don't <br/>
live on Coronado Island about 50 meters from the deserted beach, <br/>
either.  That's my kind of personal heaven--rain or shine!!!   8-)<br/>
