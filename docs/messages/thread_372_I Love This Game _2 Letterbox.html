As with Adventure Seeker, the rain didn't deter me as I took off this <br>
morning in search of the "I Love This Game #2" letterbox planted by 3 <br>
Dum Blondes. In the search area, I had to wade through some minor <br>
flooding--enough to make me wonder if I should've opted for the <br>
waterproof hiking boots, even though the salesperson assured me they <br>
really weren't necessary in "arid" SoCal.  <br>
<br>
Well, they're nice enough hiking boots just the same, though I had to <br>
skip and jump around the deeper water.  The important thing is that I <br>
was the first finder of the second 3 Dum Blondes' letterbox, and <br>
received a nice first finder bonus. Thanks 3DBs! Since it was rainy <br>
and cold, I didn't have to worry about anyone being around to spot me <br>
re-hiding your LB. You know, for some time my wife and I have <br>
pondered the idea of moving to Toronto.<br>

If you believe in the waterproof hiking boot, I've got a bridge to<br>
sell you....  ;o)<br>
