Hey, again we braved the tornadoes, deluges and flooding and <br>
attempted a few more San Diego letterboxes today.  With a bit of <br>
clarification for the Solana Stingray--we returned, experienced <br>
the 'a-ha' moment but still no success in finding the box.  It's <br>
either buried somewhere in a ton of debris or floating somewhere in <br>
the Pacific.  <br>
<br>
We then headed out to Batiquitos Lagoon and found that box with a <br>
little bit of 'alternative' hunting.  Somehow we found the box some <br>
15 paces (30 steps) away from where the clues suggest.  How we found <br>
it?  No clue!  Just saw one of those 'letterbox/geocache stick/bark <br>
altars' beneath a bush and the curiousity got the best of us.  Lo <br>
and behold, it turned out to be the very letterbox turned geocache <br>
we were seeking. Yes, we're known for tenacity (ask Ryan aka Green <br>
Tortuga about that) but we had just about given up on this box <br>
altogether when I decided to investigate the altar.  Perhaps the <br>
clues should be modified to read "from the cactus, the letterbox is <br>
hidden 3 feet due South beneath a shrub and covered with bark" <br>
instead of its current "from the cactus, take 6 adult paces at a <br>
150* heading.  Then turn to 80* and take 9 adult paces.  The <br>
letterbox is hidden under the shrub on your right beneath a covering <br>
of bark..."  I have a feeling that the evolution of this letterbox <br>
into a geocache has caused this box's migration?  ;)  Fortunately, <br>
the letterbox turned hybrid geocache was still alive and well with <br>
many visitors (mostly cachers) and it still contains its original <br>
stamp.  <br>
<br>
Then we headed off to UCSD for the series there.  Found the first <br>
two in waning light with no difficulty.  What an incredible <br>
campus!!!  That library was simply awesome!!!  Then we attempted the <br>
Sun God in virtual light-out conditions and my halogen flashlight <br>
failed to help us find this box.  :(  We explored every nook and <br>
cranny without success.  It was an interesting spot, though.  The <br>
snails had taken up residence among the same roots/vines the clues <br>
suggest the microbox to be in--it was sort of weird feeling around <br>
snails in the dark.  Fear Factor tryouts, perhaps???  Nonetheless, <br>
we enjoyed our visit immensely as it's such a beautiful campus and <br>
we even have relatives who went to med school there--now we have a <br>
better feel for the many years of their lives they spent in and <br>
around that area.  <br>
<br>
After our LB trek, we explored the library a bit more hoping to get <br>
a glimpse of the original Dr Seuss manuscripts.  Too bad it was <br>
after hours--now we have an excuse to return!!!  Linguistics played <br>
a major part in half of my undergrad degree so it was so cool to <br>
actually stumble upon such a treasure trove involving Theodor Geisel <br>
himself!!!  Thanks for another wave of great San Diego boxes.  We <br>
have a few more boxes in our sights for the couple remaining days we <br>
have in the area--hopefully, the flash flood warnings and the other <br>
weather related restrictions won't prevent us from checking them out.<br>
<br>
<br>
What a cool city San Diego had proven to be!!!  I feel like we've <br>
only scratched the surface of this town...<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>

Thanks for the info on the socal letterboxes.  We live in<br>
Carlsbad and I am getting my kids into letterboxing.  The first<br>
box we headed out to find was the Batiquitos one, to no<br>
avail.  Some disappointed kids didn't find the 'treasure'.<br>
We will return and follow your instructions from the<br>
cactus.  We were going to check out the SolB box next<br>
(hoping for some success) but now I think I will take <br>
them elsewhere or they will think Mommy has lost it<br>
dragging them all over to no avail!<br>
