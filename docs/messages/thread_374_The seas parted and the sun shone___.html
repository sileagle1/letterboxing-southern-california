Again we braved the horrendous weather and ventured out into the <br/>
region in quest of Olympic Gold--thinking that area wouldn't be too <br/>
threatened by the regional flash flood and tornado warnings.  We <br/>
found ourselves wandering amidst the myriad events of the Olympische <br/>
Spiele and were quite excited to find this letterbox alive &amp; well.  <br/>
What a surprise it was to later learn, after exploring the center, <br/>
that two teammates of mine from my college swim team are actually <br/>
training at the center for triathlon!!!  Unfortunately, they had the <br/>
holiday off today so I wasn't able to link up with them.  We spent <br/>
the rest of the afternoon seeking out geoca$he gold along the shore <br/>
of Otay Lake. Now, unlike the letterbox trek, that adventure turned <br/>
out to be a gloppy, sloppy pursuit but we persevered and made today <br/>
a twofer in spite of the crazy weather!<br/>
<br/>
Wonder when the rains will subside???<br/>
