Is anyone interested in a very low-key SoCal gathering? I have a <br/>
Thumbin Critters race-related prize to pass around to a few people <br/>
and thought it would be more fun to get together than mail it. Anyone <br/>
else want to join in? I have never been to a gathering and have only <br/>
ever met one other letterboxer, and would like to be able to put <br/>
faces with trail names...<br/>
<br/>
Here are some thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
Who: Everyone...<br/>
<br/>
What: A gathering geared toward exchanges and meeting fellow <br/>
SoCal 'boxers<br/>
<br/>
Where: A picnic-friendly park in LA or Pasadena, or even along the <br/>
coast/beach. Maybe one with no letterboxes, we plant a few for the <br/>
gathering.<br/>
<br/>
When: 1) Any weekend in April (except the 30th-Gold Rush Romp),<br/>
2) One of the last two weekends in May, 3) One of the first couple of <br/>
weekends in June. A few hours on a Saturday or Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
The date will be determined by the responses I get, so please let me <br/>
know when is best for you if you want to attend. Reply to this post <br/>

Wow...count in your Vegas neighbor too!  Last weekend in May is not good for me, nor are <br/>
most weekends in April except April 9-10 or April 30-May 1.<br/>
<br/>
It will be great to see you again, Q!<br/>
