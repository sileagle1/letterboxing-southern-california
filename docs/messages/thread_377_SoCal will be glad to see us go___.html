Well, tomorrow morn' we depart for our return trek home.  I'm sure <br>
most of you will be happy to see us go as it will likely be sunny <br>
once we depart (that's sort of how it goes in the life of a <br>
letterboxer-errant) and your inboxes won't fill up all that much in <br>
our absence! ;)  We tried and tried today to find a nice spot in <br>
which to hide a long, lost orphaned letterbox in an effort to leave <br>
a treat for all the folks who planted such neat letterboxes for us <br>
to seek out around here but, alas, it was to no avail.  We explored <br>
Cabrillo Monument, the lighthouses, the tide pools and eventually <br>
Sunset Cliffs and Dog Beach but couldn't find a spot anywhere that <br>
was 'legal' and would conceal a completely orphaned letterbox as it <br>
isn't very likely we'll get back here all that often to check on <br>
it.  (As it took 30+ years to get here the first time!!!)  We'll <br>
keep trying to find a nice spot in which to 'share' during our long <br>
& hopefully sunny drive home.  We found a bunch of spots around town <br>
just screaming for urban type boxes but we just don't have the <br>
resources for planting those types of boxes on this particular trip <br>
and aren't mentally ready for the anguishing 'upkeep' that occurs in <br>
absentia.<br>
<br>
Anyways, thanks to all the great letterbox planters (& a couple of <br>
geoca$he planters, too) down here.  We'll attempt a few more on our <br>
drive home as we're really close to achieving a personal milestone <br>
and we don't have all that many opportunities back home to aid in <br>
our quest.  Hopefully, we'll find a nice, safe place for our little <br>
box along the way home.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for a great letterboxing tour of this region!!!<br>

Have a safe trip home! It's probably too late, but I've always<br>
wondered if Fort Tejon up on the Grapevine might be a likely place...<br>
<br>
Sorry we missed you!<br>
