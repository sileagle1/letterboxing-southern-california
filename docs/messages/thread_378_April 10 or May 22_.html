Judging by my calculations using the info provided in the responses <br/>
to date, April 10 and May 22 (both Sundays) seem to be workable... If <br/>
I'm wrong, please let me know - I don't want to leave anyone out! <br/>
Especially since the letterboxing community is fairly small in <br/>
Socal :) I haven't heard from Buzzard yet, but I hope one of these <br/>
dates work for him as well...<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a preference, or any other thoughts?<br/>

Thanks!  -Q<br/>
