                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I had the opportunity to check on the placement of the letterboxing<br>
display one of our club members entered into the LA County fair, which<br>
starts this Friday in Pomona and runs for the next two weeks/three weekends.<br>
<br>
The display is in building 22, tucked away with the other educational<br>
displays and you can see the clues to the virtual letterbox on it. If anyone<br>
manages to get the stamp, be sure and email us so I can pass it along to the<br>
young man who created the display.<br>
<br>
He won a first place as well for the display :)<br>

the LA County Fair--how cool is that!?  Although I love fairs, I've <br>
never understood why LA County placed its fair at the hottest time of <br>
the year; because of that, I've rarely attended, but this year I'm <br>
going to make an exception.  Thank you Gnosis and your prize-winning <br>
member.<br>
