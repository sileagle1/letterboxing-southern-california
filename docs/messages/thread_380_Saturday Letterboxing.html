Did I stutter on my last post, or am I just repeating myself?<br>
<br>
Nancy & I had a nice lesurly Saturday of Letterboxing.  We spent the <br>
first half of the day maintaining the Hutington Beach Micros, and <br>
added one to it.  Then we headed out to Seal Beach and <br>
found "Stingray Bay", "Saint Paddy's Day Pub Crawl (both boxes)", and <br>
at dusk we were able to get "Surf Fishing".  This last one drew some <br>
interest from Naval Security.  We were monitored by a patrol boat, <br>
but was able to stamp in and get out of there just before Security <br>
Vehicles arrived. If you go after this one, you might want to NOT <br>
carry a backpack.  It must have looked awfully suspicious openening <br>
all those containers and re-planting the box.  Don - what were you <br>
thinking when you planted this one?  As always we loved the clues.<br>

  Stealth is the name of the game. If you can retrieve the "Pub Crawl" boxes, and the "Difficult Retrieve" LB in the Town series then "Surf Fishing" is a breeze. There is nothing quite like a little adrenalin rush. Did you guys get the new replacement for #2 in the Town series?<br>

No we didn't go after the replacement box for #2. We have all 7 of <br>
the original town tour--is #2 different clues or a new stamp??? We <br>
may come back to the area because there is that wonderfully great <br>
smelling cinnamon bun place that I really need to visit. We were <br>
being stealth like and there were other people down at the end on the <br>
rocks that we thought the patrol boat was paying attention to, but <br>
then it became painfully obvious that they were watching us on the <br>
sand dune. I was obscured by a block wall from them seeing me at the <br>
fence---BUT if they brought out the dogs my scent was there.<br>
<br>
Besides, if we get caught at "pub crawl" or the others in town, then <br>
the box might disappear; but at least we won't be imprisoned in the <br>
brig for espionage.  And it always make for a great letterboxing <br>
story.<br>
