Since no one had any objections to Sunday, May 22, then so be it. At <br/>
Buzzard's suggestion, I cruised through some of the picnic areas in <br/>
Griffith Park and thought they looked great for a picnic, but haven't <br/>
settled on one yet that seemed to have 'boxable areas without having <br/>
to hop in the car again (as well as ample parking nearby...) I will <br/>
post here as soon as I know.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if anyone wants to come up with a name for this event, please <br/>
do! I am at a loss, but refuse to settle on something bland (like the <br/>
SoCal Gathering or something...)<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking the hours should be noon-4, bring your own picnic. <br/>
Aside from planting a few boxes for the gathering and carving an <br/>
event stamp, this will still be a fairly low-key event, geared toward <br/>
meeting others in the area.<br/>
<br/>
I will be heading back east (to Connecticut - woe is me ;) for some <br/>
family stuff for the rest of March, so look for an update in early <br/>
April with finalized details. Until then, I welcome any suggestions! <br/>
And please email me at hitchhikerrace@sbcglobal.net to let me know if <br/>
you're coming.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  -Q<br/>
