Welcome to letterboxing! The gathering is scheduled for May 22, most <br/>
likely in Griffith Park in Los Angeles, but is still in the planning <br/>
stages. Basically we will meet other SoCal letterboxers and exchange <br/>
stamps, eat food, and possibly hunt some boxes planted especially for <br/>
the gathering. Check back here for further details early in April. <br/>
Hope to see you there! :)  -Q<br/>

Welcome to the addiction. Thanks for the Santa Clarita plants. Gwen &amp; <br/>
I haven't searched for them yet, but it is great to have some inroute <br/>
from Kernville to LA.<br/>

I just checked your membership date and realized that you probably do <br/>
not have the information on the SoCal gathering at the Old Zoo in LA. <br/>
If you check out the message archives look at message # 946, dated <br/>
4/3/2005 by Q. There will probably be other info posted as the date<br/>
(5/22) gets closer, but the info that Q has already posted at Atlas <br/>
Quest is pretty complete.    http://www.atlasquest.com <br/>
