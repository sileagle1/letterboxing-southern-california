There is what we call the "Letterbox Basement" and it was the dumping ground for unclaimed letterboxes when the LBNA site/clues procedure was changed. In Rancho Bernardo a letterbox called "Painted Rocks" went un adopted and the clues are listed in the basement. See post # 37. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement  I'm not sure the letterbox still exists, but it is a cool pictoglyph site. If you go make sure you take your binoculars as the box is a short ways away from the pictos. If the box is still in place it needs someone to adopt it.<br/>
