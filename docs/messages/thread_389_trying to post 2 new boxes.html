grrr,<br>
I have been trying to post 2 new boxes at my letterboxing.org name and<br>
been unsuccesful.<br>
We planted 1 in near Yucca Valley and another in the ladder canyons<br>
near Mecca/Salton Sea area..<br>
anyone else had any problems adding new letterboxes?<br>
seems it won't let me type in the county then says it won't add them<br>
because I did not put in the county! grr! aargh<br>
<br>
so if you are planning to be in Yucca Valley or in Painted/Ladder<br>
Canyons email me and I will give you the clues<br>
also if any of you go to Plam Springs we have 2 boxes there,<br>
please email<br>
if you arrive before we leave on the 21 or so, come by for a swim<br>
(though I am not htere this weekend)<br>
<br>
<br>
We sadly most likely will not be able to make the gathering as we are<br>
needing to be home in Canada Mar 24 to May 20th or so. Who knows though,<br>
perhaps we could sneak in quickly.<br>

I am a little late getting in on this thread but here goes...<br>
<br>
I have tried to plant a few empty micro boxes in different places <br>
throughout Disneyland and California Adventure.  I was putting them in <br>
places that I thought for sure would remain hidden such as velcroing <br>
them underneath the other side of an overhanging railing but most were <br>
gone within a week.  I had one that lasted over a month but when I <br>
checked a couple of weeks ago, it was gone.<br>
<br>
After my experiment with empty microboxes, it is my opinion that it is <br>
darn near impossible to plant boxes inside Disneyland or DCA.  You <br>
might be able to get away with one somewhere around the perimeter of <br>
the resort but I wouldn't waste the stamp material or ink trying to <br>
put one inside.<br>

Eric,<br>
     #1 An empty microbox is a geocache, not a letterbox. If it doesn't <br>

He called it an _empty microbox_. It is neither a letterbox nor a <br>
geocache. <br>

While I agree that Disneyland is too public, and too expensive for <br>
my tastes, since the 35mm canister was empty with no info inside how <br>
could that possibly reflect on letterboxing? Any guess on how many <br>
empty film canisters are found daily at Disneyland?<br>

<br>
I would venture a guess that 75% of all letterboxes have been placed <br>
without obtaining permission(this might be a pretty conservative %) <br>
from BLM, Forest Service, States, Counties, Cities, etc,etc. Every <br>
letterbox hidden in those areas could be considered trash. I tend to <br>
agree about private property, and one should gain permission prior <br>
to planting, but saying that you shouldn't do anything further on <br>
someone else's property is too far reaching. When someone plants an <br>
urban letterbox do you think that a city council or mayor are <br>
consulted? The box is planted on someone else's property- city <br>
property. The national forests belong to everyone, should the Forest <br>
Supervisor for that district be consulted prior to planting a box? <br>

How could testing a few empty 35mm film canisters possibly destroy <br>
our law-abiding, family-friendly reputation? It is an empty film <br>
canister for goodness sakes. Next time you might really read a post <br>
before you jump to conclusions. I saw nothing in Eric's post about <br>
anything other than he wouldn't waste the stamp material to put one <br>
inside Disneyland, and that the only area that a box might work <br>
would be around the perimeter. (I took that to mean "outside the <br>
park", so I guess the city of Anaheim would be the one to gain <br>
permission from).<br>

I too have wondered about Disney boxes<br>
and <br>
hasn't anyone seen the mystery boxes planted by Letterbug??<br>
They are most definitely planted in Disney world or are virtual boxes<br>
and they plant about 4 a week.<br>
if they are not virtual. then there are tons planted at Disney World<br>
just wondering how they do it<br>
we have a yearly  pass to Disneyland and would love to letterbox there<br>
<br>

thanks Princess Lea,<br>
now I do not want to sound too ignorant here<br>
but does that mean there are no boxes there,<br>
and what happens when I figure out how to get to the clues, do we<br>

so I guess that would mean there is no stamp?<br>
thanks for being patient and explaining<br>
