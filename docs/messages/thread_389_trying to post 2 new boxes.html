grrr,<br/>
I have been trying to post 2 new boxes at my letterboxing.org name and<br/>
been unsuccesful.<br/>
We planted 1 in near Yucca Valley and another in the ladder canyons<br/>
near Mecca/Salton Sea area..<br/>
anyone else had any problems adding new letterboxes?<br/>
seems it won't let me type in the county then says it won't add them<br/>
because I did not put in the county! grr! aargh<br/>
<br/>
so if you are planning to be in Yucca Valley or in Painted/Ladder<br/>
Canyons email me and I will give you the clues<br/>
also if any of you go to Plam Springs we have 2 boxes there,<br/>
please email<br/>
if you arrive before we leave on the 21 or so, come by for a swim<br/>
(though I am not htere this weekend)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We sadly most likely will not be able to make the gathering as we are<br/>
needing to be home in Canada Mar 24 to May 20th or so. Who knows though,<br/>
perhaps we could sneak in quickly.<br/>

<br/>
I am a little late getting in on this thread but here goes...<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to plant a few empty micro boxes in different places <br/>
throughout Disneyland and California Adventure.  I was putting them in <br/>
places that I thought for sure would remain hidden such as velcroing <br/>
them underneath the other side of an overhanging railing but most were <br/>
gone within a week.  I had one that lasted over a month but when I <br/>
checked a couple of weeks ago, it was gone.<br/>
<br/>
After my experiment with empty microboxes, it is my opinion that it is <br/>
darn near impossible to plant boxes inside Disneyland or DCA.  You <br/>
might be able to get away with one somewhere around the perimeter of <br/>
the resort but I wouldn't waste the stamp material or ink trying to <br/>
put one inside.<br/>

     #1 An empty microbox is a geocache, not a letterbox. If it doesn't <br/>
have a stamp, why call it a letterbox?<br/>
     #2 You shouldn't be trying to place boxes (eiter geocache OR <br/>
letterboxes) on private property without the owners permission. <br/>
Disneyland in particular is cleaned &amp; maintained so thoroughly <br/>
everyday, monitored with video cameras so heavily, and probably a <br/>
pretty major security &amp; terrorist threat, what made you think you would <br/>
get away with planting a box/cache there anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for trying to create an experience for all of us, but please <br/>
don't do anything further on someone else's property without <br/>
permission. Both geocaching &amp; letterboxing are under fire right now in <br/>
some states as some people see us as littering, trespassing &amp; trampling <br/>

He called it an _empty microbox_. It is neither a letterbox nor a <br/>
geocache. <br/>

While I agree that Disneyland is too public, and too expensive for <br/>
my tastes, since the 35mm canister was empty with no info inside how <br/>
could that possibly reflect on letterboxing? Any guess on how many <br/>
empty film canisters are found daily at Disneyland?<br/>

<br/>
I would venture a guess that 75% of all letterboxes have been placed <br/>
without obtaining permission(this might be a pretty conservative %) <br/>
from BLM, Forest Service, States, Counties, Cities, etc,etc. Every <br/>
letterbox hidden in those areas could be considered trash. I tend to <br/>
agree about private property, and one should gain permission prior <br/>
to planting, but saying that you shouldn't do anything further on <br/>
someone else's property is too far reaching. When someone plants an <br/>
urban letterbox do you think that a city council or mayor are <br/>
consulted? The box is planted on someone else's property- city <br/>
property. The national forests belong to everyone, should the Forest <br/>
Supervisor for that district be consulted prior to planting a box? <br/>
<br/>

How could testing a few empty 35mm film canisters possibly destroy <br/>
our law-abiding, family-friendly reputation? It is an empty film <br/>
canister for goodness sakes. Next time you might really read a post <br/>
before you jump to conclusions. I saw nothing in Eric's post about <br/>
anything other than he wouldn't waste the stamp material to put one <br/>
inside Disneyland, and that the only area that a box might work <br/>
would be around the perimeter. (I took that to mean "outside the <br/>
park", so I guess the city of Anaheim would be the one to gain <br/>
permission from).<br/>

I too have wondered about Disney boxes<br/>
and <br/>
hasn't anyone seen the mystery boxes planted by Letterbug??<br/>
They are most definitely planted in Disney world or are virtual boxes<br/>
and they plant about 4 a week.<br/>
if they are not virtual. then there are tons planted at Disney World<br/>
just wondering how they do it<br/>
we have a yearly  pass to Disneyland and would love to letterbox there<br/>

thanks Princess Lea,<br/>
now I do not want to sound too ignorant here<br/>
but does that mean there are no boxes there,<br/>
and what happens when I figure out how to get to the clues, do we<br/>
search on a map on the computer?<br/>
so I guess that would mean there is no stamp?<br/>
thanks for being patient and explaining<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   How could testing a few empty 35mm film canisters possibly<br/>
destroy <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   our law-abiding, family-friendly reputation? It is an empty film <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   canister for goodness sakes. Next time you might really read a<br/>
post <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   before you jump to conclusions. I saw nothing in Eric's post<br/>
about <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   anything other than he wouldn't waste the stamp material to<br/>
put one <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   inside Disneyland, and that the only area that a box might work <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   would be around the perimeter. (I took that to mean "outside the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   park", so I guess the city of Anaheim would be the one to gain <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   permission from).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Don<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; ...it is my opinion that it is <br/>
