I say almost as I was unable to place it in the original place as this has been totally overwhelmed with poisen ivy and there would be no safe way to place it without getting a  chance of a severe rash!! I have instead placed it 15 Paces further along the trail (walking down away from the waterfall) between two rocks beneath a shrub and covered with a smaller rock.<br>
The waterfall is terrific at the moment, an absolute torrent, and the water is almost lapping at the paths this end of the lake. Several streams go across the trail instead of using the manmade routes and the birdlife is abundant!! We saw 25 birds that we could postively ID. the highlights being an osprey, white shouldered kite and several pairs of western grebes.<br>
 <br>
Let me know if there is anything else I can do.<br>
