Q asked me about the first letterbox I found and i didn't have the <br>
name of the letterbox and i still don't. It was located under a sw <br>
corner of a brown storage bin at the intersection of western canyon <br>
and west observatory road.The name was something mystery. I have <br>
been trying to find the information on the letterboxing sight but i <br>
can't seem to find it for you. I'm sorry that i can't find the <br>
information, but when i see you all then i can show you the <br>
letterbox and maybe you can help me find the information. I have <br>
collected some other finds since then.<br>

Hi Geogeorgia,<br>
I think the box you found was a different kind of letterbox called a <br>
mystery box, and the locations of those letterboxes should remain a <br>
secret. Please be careful what you post on this chatlist or any <br>
other chatlists for that matter. From what you wrote in the post it <br>
sounded like you have that letterbox in your possession? If you do <br>
have the box in your possession that is a big no no. You are not <br>
supposed to keep the letterbox, just get a print off of the stamp <br>
for your logbook. I think that you should take some time and read <br>
the info on the LBNA web site before you do more letterboxing. Could <br>
you tell me what other letterboxes you have found and did you pick <br>
those up also?<br>
