I recently returned from a fishing trip outside of Yuma, Arizona, <br>
where I planted a 4-stamp series along Highway 95.  The clues are <br>
newly posted on Atlas Quest and Letterboxing.org, so please check <br>
them out if any of you are traveling to the Sonora Desert. It's going <br>
to be hot out there soon, but three of the four stamps are drive-bys. <br>
There's also a fifth stamp planted in Yuma by Azroadie. The trail to <br>
my stamps starts at the intersection of Interstate 8 and Highway 95. <br>
Hey Don, they've got some Javelina hunting out there.<br>
