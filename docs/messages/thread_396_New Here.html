Hi everyone. I am very new to the game. Actually, we are planning to <br>
look for our first letterboxes this week. We live in Fresno, but are <br>
drawn to the beaches of southern Cali. We will be in the SLO area <br>
this week and I have found clues to several boxes in the area. I <br>
found this board and thought it would be fun get to know others who <br>
plant/hunt in the same areas. I'm hoping for some sunshine!<br>

Sheri,<br>
You may want to go www.atlasquest.com and do city-centered searches <br>
of the areas you will be driving through. Not only is this a great <br>
way to find letterboxes along your route, but some the boxes specify <br>
if they are "drive-by" boxes or not.<br>

Hi Sheri,<br>
I hope you went through Chalome on your way to SLO as "The Little <br>
Bastard" is a driveby. You might want to spend several days here in <br>
Kernville, and if it is later in the season then you could take the <br>
road from Spingville and collect a bunch of images.<br>

Ok, I see how this could become addictive. We had so much fun looking <br>
for boxes. We found 6 of the 10 looked for. I probably have more gray <br>
hair than I left with.<br>
<br>
Don, We were going to look for The Little Bastard on the way home, but <br>
we were pressed for time. I even pointed to the trees and told my <br>
husband that there's a box in those trees. But, he wouldn't stop, lol.<br>
<br>
We are officially "Mic n Goof" if anyone should find our mark.<br>
