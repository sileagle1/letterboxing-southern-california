Hi everyone, I was out hiking in the hills behind my house today and <br/>
was able to confirm that the "Passport to the Falls" letterbox is<br/>
still <br/>
in place.  This box was planted in April of '03, so has been in place <br/>
nearly two years. This is a beautiful and easy hike for dogs and <br/>
children to a historic area in my San Gabriel Mountains. You'll have<br/>
to <br/>
boulder hop across the creek a few times, but it's a friendly creek,<br/>
so <br/>
a slip will only get your jeans wet.<br/>
