                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our entire group will be at the fair on the 16th for the day, with some of<br/>
us (I'm hoping for more than the two who have volunteered) working at the<br/>
4-H booth from 2pm until 4pm. The booth is located outside the small<br/>
livestock building.<br/>
<br/>
We've been discussing what to do while in the booth, since part of our<br/>
purpose there is to educate the public in some way about 4-H or what you can<br/>
do within the organization. It is currently a debate between teaching about<br/>
letterboxing and teaching about flat travelers. Should they go with<br/>
letterboxing, I plan to have the kid(s) handing out information on boxing<br/>
and also clues to a few boxes in that area.<br/>
<br/>
I mention this because, if anyone who has boxes near Pomona would prefer not<br/>
to have their clues distributed in such a way, please let me know before the<br/>
15th (the day I'm having the packets made).<br/>
