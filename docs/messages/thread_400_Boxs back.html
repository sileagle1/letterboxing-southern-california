Hello,<br/>
Before anyone else starts criticising me i think i was able to return <br/>
the stamps i collected . This last week i didn't have to drive my bus <br/>
and had the week off so i went back to all of the letterbox locations <br/>
and i think i got them all back in the right spots. I looked again at <br/>
the information  at the letterboxsite but it really didn't say <br/>
anything about collecting the stamps or fixing the baggies ether but i <br/>
did it anyway. I did have some time in the last of the week to visit <br/>
my aunt in Portland so i was able to do some letterboxing there too. I <br/>
think im pretty sure i did everything right  and i did not take any of <br/>
the stamps or the baggies.  Is there anybody that does geocaching and <br/>
letterboxing. GEOgeorgia<br/>
