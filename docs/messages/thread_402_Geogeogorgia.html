  Hi Don & Gwen,<br>
  This is still too funny!  =)  Thanks for giving me<br>
  "credit" on the clue listing...what did I do? <br>
  Just to clarify...(so I don't blow anything) are there<br>
  still those among the faithful  who haven't figured<br>
  out the masterminds behind Geogeorgia?<br>
  BTW, when I stamped in on the 17th I don't think I<br>
  signed a name, I usually don't... but of course you<br>
  know that since you were there just yesterday =)  <br>
  I thought the box stamp was GG's personal<br>
  stamp...actually I thought the other one was a mule,<br>
  oh well, perhaps we'll be seeing more of that stamp<br>
  around!<br>
      -Alarch, getting ready to spring forward <br>

I'm still a little confused too! The only things I could gather were <br>
from the LBNA site in the LA letterbox listings.  I'm still unclear <br>
as to whether there actually is a box or not, although it sounds <br>
like there is??<br>
