                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for your reply to my message.  I am aware of what a letterbox is <br/>
(notice who is the owner of this group<grin>) and I am aware of what a <br/>
geocache is (note that it is not an empty container but one which contains <br/>
items for trade).<br/>
<br/>
I have to echo what Don said about most letterboxes being placed without <br/>
permission.  By leaving a letterbox somewhere, we are committing an act of <br/>
property abandonment (defined as abandoning, discarding, or otherwise <br/>
leaving any personal property).  While one could argue the semantics (i.e. <br/>
the box isn't abandoned because people will be coming to it), we do leave a <br/>
box somewhere without any intention of ever picking that box up again (with <br/>
some notable exceptions of temporary letterboxes to commemorate events, <br/>
gatherings, etc.).  As such, the mere act of placing a letterbox means that <br/>
we are all breaking the law unless we receive the express permission of <br/>
whatever enitity or individual owns, controls or oversees the land.  There <br/>
is not a square inch of land that is not under the direct control of some <br/>
entity that we would need to get permission from with the exception of your <br/>
own property.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I do excercise caution when planting my boxes and try to <br/>
avoid places that finding a suspicous container would cause a panic (i.e., <br/>
no airport or mall letterboxes).  The experiment at the Disney parks was <br/>
done merely to see if it was even remotely possible to find other hiding <br/>
places and was done with an intentionally innocuous container that is <br/>
readily found every day in the parks that would cause no panic if found.<br/>
<br/>
I do not and will not do anything to destroy the (semi-)law-abiding (see <br/>
property abandonment above), family friendly reputation of letterboxing as <br/>
this is a hobby I enjoy and I love to see it growing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;     #1 An empty microbox is a geocache, not a letterbox. If it doesn't<br/>
&gt; have a stamp, why call it a letterbox?<br/>
&gt;     #2 You shouldn't be trying to place boxes (eiter geocache OR<br/>
&gt; letterboxes) on private property without the owners permission.<br/>
&gt; Disneyland in particular is cleaned &amp; maintained so thoroughly<br/>
&gt; everyday, monitored with video cameras so heavily, and probably a<br/>
&gt; pretty major security &amp; terrorist threat, what made you think you would<br/>
&gt; get away with planting a box/cache there anyway?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for trying to create an experience for all of us, but please<br/>
&gt; don't do anything further on someone else's property without<br/>
&gt; permission. Both geocaching &amp; letterboxing are under fire right now in<br/>
&gt; some states as some people see us as littering, trespassing &amp; trampling<br/>
&gt; the wilderness. Please don't do anything further to destroy our law-<br/>
&gt; abiding, family-friendly reputation.<br/>
