Hello Californians!<br/>
<br/>
I am an Ohioan who will be visiting the San Diego area next week and <br/>
it was suggested I join this group for some informaiton on boxes in <br/>
the area.  I hope you don't mind my brief visit.<br/>
<br/>
It has been interesting to read past posts and be reminded how <br/>
different and how similar letterboxing is across the ocuntry!<br/>
<br/>
I will be in the San Diego area Thursday April 28-Sunday May 1.  I <br/>
have quite a list of boxes that I hope to get and woudl appreicate <br/>
any input you might wnat to give.  At this point, due to limited <br/>
time, I have limited myself to shorter hikes.  IF you know for <br/>
certain any box is missing, I owuld appreciate a heads up, but I <br/>
don't expect a "guarantee" that a box is in place either.  I am <br/>
really looking forward to exploring a bit of San Diego!<br/>
<br/>
Here is my very general wish list:<br/>
<br/>
Hitchcok series (lake FOrest)<br/>
Olympic Pentathalon (Mission Viejo)<br/>
Mission San Juan Capistrano<br/>
San Diego Sails <br/>
USCD Series<br/>
Tea Time Letterbox (Reportedly a must-get)<br/>
Gliderport Microbox (reported missing, but billed as a really cool <br/>
place, so worth a visiit)<br/>
La Jolla<br/>
4th Grade Hawk Box ( get a virtual stamp)<br/>
Old Town San Diego<br/>
Ski Beach Microbox<br/>
<br/>
The majority of my boxing time will be Thursday afternoon with a few <br/>
breif forrays early morning (the benefits of Eastern Time Zone!)  <br/>
Interestingly enough, ScoutDogs, from Indiana will also be in the <br/>
area at the same time.  Her schedule is a bit more  limited but we <br/>
would love to meet for an exchange if at all possible!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting you all thorugh your boxes, if not on the <br/>
trails,<br/>

Hi Mama Stork,<br/>

&gt; Olympic Pentathalon (Mission Viejo)<br/>
<br/>
Gwen &amp; I hit this series March 13, 2005. Number 2 in the series was <br/>
missing, and we sent a note to the placer, so possibly it has been <br/>
replaced. If you are going to be based in San Diego then this will be <br/>
about an hour drive north. It is about a 3 miler, but generally no <br/>
major elevation gain. We pushed a stroller.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The walk is around the lake (for the most part) and there is limited parking near the letterboxes. It would be possible to do it in sections. I believe the clue states something like"this is the longest stretch between boxes" and at that point you could retrace your steps to your car and drive to the next box. The last box is fairly close to your starting point, so if you were to drive the route first then you would have a better idea of how to break it up.  <br/>
