 <br>
The abandoned petroglyphs cache at Lake Hodges is back in situ, albeit 15 paces further along the trail due to poisen ivy at it's original site. That is a short hike but v. beautiful scenery.<br>
 <br>
There are a couple of lb in Poway that I have not found but appear to be easily accessable.<br>
I am free most afternoons and would welcome the chance to go LBing with you.<br>
