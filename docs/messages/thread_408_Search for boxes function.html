I just checked out the new improved search for boxes function. The old <br/>
function seemed to require that the entire box name be used to find <br/>
the letterbox listing you were looking for. Now it seems to work more <br/>
like google, and if you type in one word from the title it will pull <br/>
up a listing of letterboxes with that word in the title. If you type <br/>
in "missing" for example, the listing will include all of those boxes <br/>
where the placer has put that word in the title after they have edited <br/>
the box clues.(I just thought of a great title for a letterbox-<br/>
"Missing") You no longer have to search the map list for clues in a <br/>
specific area. Instead you can type in the county name only with no <br/>
other information and it will give you a list of the boxes in that <br/>
county only. Before you needed a lot more information typed in before <br/>
you could find clues, and it was easier then to just go to the map <br/>
listings.<br/>
