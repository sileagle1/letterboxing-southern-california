Hi, all-<br/>
Does anyone know the status of the Eaton Canyon box? Alas, it seems<br/>
"contact the placer" isn't working right now on lbna.<br/>

This is my bad. I recovered the Eaton Canyon box after the heavy rains <br/>
soaked the logbook, and have not returned it because the poison oak has <br/>
grown up so thickly around its hiding place (and I'm extremely <br/>
allergic). I'll replace it this weekend with a new logbook, and bring <br/>
something to try and clear a path to the box.<br/>

Thanks Buzzard. Be careful of the poison oak! When I was there a few<br/>
weeks ago, I kind of circled around and approached from the other<br/>
side, and got to (I think =) ) the hiding spot, unscathed. But I was<br/>
walking on air, anyway 'cuz I'd just found Other Canyons Series #1 -<br/>
safe, dry, and completely unharmed by the winter floods! With a<br/>
hitchhiker! Wahoo!<br/>

I walked up the street to return the Eaton Canyon Letterbox to its <br/>
hiding place this morning, but I just couldn't get past the poison <br/>
oak.  Much of the poison oak is waist high, and it completely<br/>
surrounds <br/>
the LB's hiding place.  There's even poison oak growing up from where <br/>
the letterbox is to be buried.  Unfortunately, I'm extremely allergic <br/>
to poison oak, as in going to the doctor allergic.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a sentimental attachement to this LB, because it's the one<br/>
that <br/>
introduced me to letterboxing, my first stamp and all that, back in <br/>
February 2003. I'll ask California Bear if I might hide it in a safer <br/>
location nearby.<br/>

Sorry, not a Black Widow. It's a little June Bug<br/>
released in July '03.  The last stamp in the log is Sept.'03! If Black<br/>
Widow HH was in the Eaton Canyon letterbox, Buzzard has that box now<br/>
and might see it in the log. Hope it turns up!  June Bug was actually<br/>
in the Other Canyons series #1 box, Moist Canyon. She's traveling in<br/>
her own stylish little altoids tin, so I haven't been able to move her<br/>
on yet. (So many microboxes!) <br/>
  -Alarch<br/>
p.s. I've heard of two different HH lists, how should I decide which<br/>
one to use, does it matter? Thanks! <br/>
