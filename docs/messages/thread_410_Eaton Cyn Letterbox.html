This is my bad. I recovered the Eaton Canyon box after the heavy rains <br>
soaked the logbook, and have not returned it because the poison oak has <br>
grown up so thickly around its hiding place (and I'm extremely <br>
allergic). I'll replace it this weekend with a new logbook, and bring <br>
something to try and clear a path to the box.<br>

Thanks Buzzard. Be careful of the poison oak! When I was there a few<br>
weeks ago, I kind of circled around and approached from the other<br>
side, and got to (I think =) ) the hiding spot, unscathed. But I was<br>
walking on air, anyway 'cuz I'd just found Other Canyons Series #1 -<br>
safe, dry, and completely unharmed by the winter floods! With a<br>
hitchhiker! Wahoo!<br>

I walked up the street to return the Eaton Canyon Letterbox to its <br>
hiding place this morning, but I just couldn't get past the poison <br>
oak.  Much of the poison oak is waist high, and it completely<br>
surrounds <br>
the LB's hiding place.  There's even poison oak growing up from where <br>
the letterbox is to be buried.  Unfortunately, I'm extremely allergic <br>
to poison oak, as in going to the doctor allergic.  <br>
<br>
I have a sentimental attachement to this LB, because it's the one<br>
that <br>
introduced me to letterboxing, my first stamp and all that, back in <br>
February 2003. I'll ask California Bear if I might hide it in a safer <br>
location nearby.<br>

Please let me know if it is and I'll add it to the hitchhiker list.<br>

Sorry, not a Black Widow. It's a little June Bug<br>

Widow HH was in the Eaton Canyon letterbox, Buzzard has that box now<br>
and might see it in the log. Hope it turns up!  June Bug was actually<br>
in the Other Canyons series #1 box, Moist Canyon. She's traveling in<br>
her own stylish little altoids tin, so I haven't been able to move her<br>
on yet. (So many microboxes!) <br>
  -Alarch<br>
p.s. I've heard of two different HH lists, how should I decide which<br>
one to use, does it matter? Thanks! <br>
