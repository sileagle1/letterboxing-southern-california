<br/>
Just a quick note for those planning on traveling to Escondido to do <br/>
some letterboxing - the "Christmas Vacation" letterbox is missing, <br/>
and I've emailed the planters to let them know.  I was easily able <br/>
to find the location of the box, but all that was left was the lid!  <br/>
I hunted around quite a bit to see if I could find the logbook or <br/>
stamp, but to no avail.  Bummer!<br/>
<br/>
On a happier note, I was able to find the "Painted Rocks" box near <br/>
Lake Hodges in Rancho Bernardo.  It was perched right on top of some <br/>
rocks, not hidden, and in plain view of the trail.  This box is <br/>
listed in the letterbox basement, and I was glad that someone had <br/>
taken the time to give the box some TLC, but it appeared that the <br/>
last entry (before me the other day) was in 2003!  I thought that <br/>
some people had visited since then, but perhaps not.  It was a very <br/>
nice hike - the waterfall was running, and the day was beautiful, <br/>
and the box has been rehidden.<br/>
<br/>
Have a good rest of your week!<br/>
Cattail  :)<br/>
