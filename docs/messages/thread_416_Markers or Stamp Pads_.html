<br>
I know this has been a topic of discussion before, but want to see what <br>
you guys think... I'm getting ready to retire my stamp pads since <br>
they're getting old and cruddy.  I'm also tired of having only two <br>
colors to stamp with.  I'm thinking about going with markers, like the <br>
Marvy's, but WOW!-- they sure can be pricey! I went to Michaels and <br>
they were selling for $20 for a pack of 10.  Are they really that good? <br>
Is there any way to get diversity in colors without having to shell out <br>
too much dough? Any tips on where to go for better deals?<br>

Thanks!<br>

Funny you should bring this up.  I have always used ink pads (6 <br>
colors for variety), but at the Gold Rush Romp gathering in Northern <br>
Cal 2 weeks ago, I saw many using markers.  So I went out and bought <br>
a set of Marvy markers (about 20 markers in a metal tin for $20) from <br>
Michael's for a box I plan to plant at the May gathering in Griffith <br>
Park.  They may have been the wrong type, but they did not properly <br>
cover like ink pads do, so I returned them.  They did not say they <br>
were specificly for rubber stamping, but I beleive others did.<br>

water-soluble stamps in wet logbooks! I love brush pens, but it's been<br>

stamp the first ones can dry  while you're adding the others. I also<br>
bought one of the "option" pads with the 12 lift-out sections. It's<br>
awkward compared to pens, but the colors are cool and the coverage is<br>
pretty consistant. It was abt. $18.00.  Call around, or check the web,<br>
because it comes in different color themes- at that price, you should<br>
have a choice! :)<br>

<br>
When you do your stamping with markers, the first ink you apply will<br>
often dry before you finish coloring the rest of the stamp, so be sure<br>
to breathe heavily on it just before stamping. It helps to "moisten"<br>
the stamp and can improve your results dramatically! =)<br>
<br>
I've also noticed that markers don't tend to work as well on large,<br>
blocky areas where you might end up with streaks or else the ink<br>
congels into little dots. (Not sure what to call that effect!)<br>
<br>
So don't be fooled--markers aren't perfect for everything, but they do<br>
have their uses! =)<br>
