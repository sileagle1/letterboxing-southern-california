I retired my Marvys from letterboxing after seeing what happens to<br/>
water-soluble stamps in wet logbooks! I love brush pens, but it's been<br/>
hard to find a waterproof substitute. Pens are a bit tricky, too. You<br/>
can get streaks inking large areas, and if you use several on one<br/>
stamp the first ones can dry  while you're adding the others. I also<br/>
bought one of the "option" pads with the 12 lift-out sections. It's<br/>
awkward compared to pens, but the colors are cool and the coverage is<br/>
pretty consistant. It was abt. $18.00.  Call around, or check the web,<br/>
because it comes in different color themes- at that price, you should<br/>
have a choice! :)<br/>

&gt; Hi Folks,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know this has been a topic of discussion before, but want to see<br/>
what <br/>
&gt; you guys think... I'm getting ready to retire my stamp pads since <br/>
&gt; they're getting old and cruddy.  I'm also tired of having only two <br/>
&gt; colors to stamp with.  I'm thinking about going with markers, like<br/>
the <br/>
&gt; Marvy's, but WOW!-- they sure can be pricey! I went to Michaels and <br/>
&gt; they were selling for $20 for a pack of 10.  Are they really that<br/>
good? <br/>
