Wooly has been recarved and replanted! It's in the same area, but a <br/>
slightly different hiding place.  We'll see how long it lasts this <br/>
time! FOr those of you who have found Wooly before, the stamp is a <br/>
recreation of the original image, but I think he looks cuter this <br/>
time.  Apparently he ate a lot while he was away (perhaps from <br/>
boredom?)! =)<br/>

  yipee-we will go look for wooly soon---we are also headed to Yosemite and wonder if there are many boxes along the way...  Any suggestions?  c-bear and KOKO...<br/>
<br/>
  As you head north on Hwy 14 there is some new boxes in Santa Clarita, Robbers Roost at Vasquez Rocks,10 Million Dollar Baby in Mojave, Desert Tortoise at Jaw Bone Canyon, 2 boxes at Red Rock Canyon(we only found Katpaus), Burro Schmidt's Tunnel is about 9 miles off Hwy 14 on a dirt road and it will take you 1hr in and 1 hr out, All 4 boxes of the Coyote Stage Robbery , Then you will be on Hwy 395 and you could stop and nab Fossil Falls either where it should be or where the last bozo left it(maybe you can fix it?). Katpau have 2 near Lone Pine;Charcoal Kilns &amp; Alabama Hills, then onto Laws in Bishop. Now if you want to go toward Mammoth Lakes when you leave or before you go the Yosemite then you could nab our (6) Hwy 395 Enigmas, Opposites and Illusions, but you should definately hit those in the order they are listed. If you are going after June 15 then you might look for some of the new plants. <br/>
