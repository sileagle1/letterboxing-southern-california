                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Gang! Just a friendly reminder: The Old Zoo Gathering is less <br>
than a week away! There are 15 letterboxes waiting to be hunted and <br>
the clues will be available the day of. (Yes, I've been busy...) <br>
<br>
The first seven are the Old Zoo series which are really close <br>
together and hopefully won't take more than an hour or so to hunt. <br>
This series is geared toward kids and those who might not be up for a <br>
hike. This series will be pulled after the gathering - the Old Zoo <br>
picnic area is always pretty busy and I doubt they would survive long <br>
anyway.<br>
<br>
The next series is a surprise, but is geared toward those who DO want <br>
to hike. I have hiked every trail leading out from the Old Zoo to the <br>
top of Mt. Hollywood and found the easiest, which is still a moderate <br>
loop that takes an hour and a half without stopping to find a bunch <br>
of letterboxes along the way. I figure a good time to hunt these is <br>
after lunch, when it's nice and hot :)<br>
<br>
Also, I hate to exclude anyone from letterboxes, but just so everyone <br>
is aware, there are two letterboxes that will be available only to a <br>
select few who took place in the Thumbin' Critters Hitchhiker Race. <br>
Sorry!<br>
<br>
I strongly suggest everyone bring: lunch, lots of water, sunscreen, <br>
bug repellent (though they aren't too bad yet), ink pads (none of my <br>
boxes will have them), and comfy shoes!<br>
<br>
Ok, and now for the bad news. There is a very real possibility that I <br>
will have to work on the day of my own gathering. :( I won't bore you <br>
to death with the nuances of my job, but when there's work I have to <br>
take it, and I'm pretty sure there will be. If so, my boyfriend has <br>
volunteered to go early and save some picnic tables until the <br>
majority of the group gets there. He is not much of a letterboxer, so <br>
he won't stay the entire time, but at least long enough to hand over <br>
the event box and race boxes to someone responsible. I will try my <br>
best to show up at noon for lunch so I can at least meet everyone :)<br>
<br>
Anyway, in the next day or so I will post directions to the Old Zoo <br>
picnic area and the exact tables I hope to get, so check back! And I <br>
look forward to seeing everybody on Sunday!  -Q<br>
