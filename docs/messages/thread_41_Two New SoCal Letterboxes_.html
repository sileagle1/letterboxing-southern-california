The Succulent Box II<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Buzzard<br/>
Placement date: September 13, 2003<br/>
State: California<br/>
County: Los Angeles<br/>
Nearest City: Arcadia<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
Difficulty:  Easy.  The Los Angeles County Arboretum is stroller and <br/>
wheelchair friendly, and young children abound.<br/>
<br/>
Clues<br/>
<br/>
In the LETTERBOX-USA Newsgroup, there have been a number of posts <br/>
regarding the Succulent Box letterbox previously located in the Los <br/>
Angeles County Arboretum.  Several people have recently searched for <br/>
the box, and it has been conclusively established that this letterbox <br/>
has gone missing.  Well, not anymoreI've decided to resurrect it.  <br/>
Using my stamp book image of the original Succulent Box stamp, I've <br/>
carved a replica, and have planted it in the arboretum near the <br/>
location of the original placement.  This counts as a new letterbox <br/>
because . . . well, because I say so.  The following clues utilize <br/>
the original Succulent Box clues, with additional text by me.  I <br/>
remember having difficulty deciphering the name of the original <br/>
planters, but my stamp book says it was planted by "The Sako Clan."<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is located at the Los Angeles County Arboretum. To <br/>
find the Arboretum, exit the 210 Freeway on Baldwin Avenue. Turn <br/>
south on Baldwin Avenue; the Arboretum is on the west side of <br/>
Baldwin. Admission fee is $6.00 for adults, $4.00 for seniors and <br/>
students, and $1.50 for children 5-12 years.  Every 3rd Tuesday of <br/>
the month is free.  <br/>
<br/>
 [Original Clues]  Everything about this letterbox is HOT. In fact, <br/>
it is so hot that we don't want you to get burned. It will be best to <br/>
visit this letterbox early in the morning when there are few visitors <br/>
at the park. The Arboretum opens at 9 am daily. Find the place in the <br/>
gardens where the heat loving plants grow. You will find a grove of <br/>
succulent plants. From the grove of succulents, find a place made of <br/>
bricks baked in the hot sun. In the courtyard, find a place with the <br/>
potential to be 700 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
[My Clues]  If you've found the right spot, you'll see two metal <br/>
doors (to the left of this spot, you'll see a cauldron).  Behind the <br/>
lower door is the hiding place of the original Succulent Box.  From <br/>
this location, take the west exit out of the enclosure and <br/>
immediately turn left (south), walking between a white wall and a <br/>
wooden fence.  Keep walking south until you step under the branches <br/>
of a large oak tree.  The Succulent Box II letterbox is hidden in the <br/>
center of the oak's trunk, under a rock and some leaves.<br/>

The Los Angeles County Arboretum &amp; Botanic Garden Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Buzzard<br/>
Placement date: September 13, 2003<br/>
State: California<br/>
County: Los Angeles<br/>
Nearest City: Arcadia<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
Difficulty: Easy. The arboretum is stroller and wheelchair friendly, <br/>
but this particular letterbox requires climbing some stairs, which is <br/>
fine for small children, but not wheel chairs.<br/>

<br/>
There are lots of little waterfalls in the Arboretumfind the big <br/>
one.  To the right of the big waterfall are steps traveling up the <br/>
hill to the top.  The steps are concrete with black metal handrails.  <br/>
The left metal handrail will lead you to the letterbox.  Walk up the <br/>
steps following the left metal handrail until you reach the small <br/>
wooden bridge at the top of the falls.  Here, there is a fork in the <br/>
trail; take the right fork, continuing to follow the left black metal <br/>
handrail uphill until the handrail ends.  36 inches past the end of <br/>
the left handrail, under the wooden beam in the ground that borders <br/>
the cement slab, you will find a ledge that harbors the letterbox.<br/>

great spot to hide a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for giving us the first shot!<br/>

This sounds bad, the waterfall letterbox was not a microbox.  How <br/>
could anyone have found it in THAT hiding place.  I figured the <br/>
Succulent II was the one to worry about.<br/>
