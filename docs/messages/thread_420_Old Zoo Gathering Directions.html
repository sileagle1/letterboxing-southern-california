Park website also has a map, which should help. <br>

<br>
Also, I do have to work tomorrow, and have to leave at the latest by <br>
10:30am. I will probably arrive at the park no later than 8am to save <br>
the tables for us, so if anyone wants to show up early to ensure an <br>
exchange with me, please feel free to do so. Also, if anyone wants to <br>
help out with babysitting the letterboxes and clues that I am leaving <br>
behind, I would really appreciate it... See you tomorrow! -Q<br>

Directions<br>
<br>
There are a million ways to enter Griffith Park, but to get to the <br>
Old Zoo Picnic Area, you need to turn onto Griffith Park Drive from <br>
Crystal Springs Drive, which parallels I-5. There are three exits off <br>
the I-5 that get you to Griffith Park: Los Feliz Blvd., Griffith <br>
Park, and Zoo Dr. In all cases, just follow the signs to the park  <br>
they will take you to Crystal Springs Dr. From Los Feliz and Griffith <br>
Park exits, you need to head north on Crystal Springs and turn left <br>
on Griffith Park Drive  there are signs that list the Old Zoo area <br>
this way. From Zoo Drive, you need to head south on Crystal Springs <br>
and turn right on Griffith Park Dr. Going south on the I-5, I don't <br>
think there is a Griffith Park exit so take one of the other two.<br>
