Q the thanks go to you! We wish you could have stayed longer too, but <br/>
duty calls. This was a great size--smaller is better.<br/>

<br/>
WE HAD A BLAST!!! Thanks for taking the time to plant all the boxes! <br/>
And such beautiful stamps too!! We've  gained quite a memorable shared <br/>
experience forging uphill in the sweltering heat. A day full of fun and <br/>
letterboxing! This was my first gathering, and we can't wait to do this <br/>
again! It was nice meeting everyone! Hope to see you all again soon!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you soooo very much for the fun time we had at the gathering you <br/>
organized.  It was a sucessful event we thought.  The heat did me <br/>
(Nancy) in so I didn't do the intense hike that most of the others did. <br/>
We finished the day w/a total of 21 stamps found. We made it to our 300 <br/>
found mark. You did a beautiful job on your carvings and placements <br/>
too. Hope to get to see you again and was very nice meeting you. Sorry <br/>
you had to go to work--I hate when that happens. Take care and thanks <br/>
again.<br/>
