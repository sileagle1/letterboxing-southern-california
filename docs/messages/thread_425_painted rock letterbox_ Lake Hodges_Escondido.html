  Hi,<br/>
  We went looking for the painted rock letterbox today. Found a geocache <br/>

  trail to the tree and didn't find anything. I was afraid of poison ivy <br/>

I'd provide some hints on this box for anyone interested.  I'm <br/>
pretty sure the box has been moved since Don and Gwen visited four <br/>
years ago (see below).<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so this is a really great trail.  There's a message in the <br/>
letterbox basement archives about how the box has been moved from <br/>
its original location (which has been swamped with poison ivy), but <br/>
I can't seem to find it right now.  When I went to find this box <br/>
last month, I found the original spot (which was pretty easy) but <br/>
then had a challenging time locating this box at its new spot - <br/>
the "revised" clues simply said it's 15 paces down the trail, <br/>
underneath a bush between two rocks.<br/>
<br/>
So here's some clarification on that - go 10-15 paces down the trail <br/>
(away from the waterfall, downhill), and the box will be on your <br/>
right-hand side.  The bush/shrub that you're looking for is quite <br/>
clear - there are two large-melon sized rocks right underneath it <br/>
(touching each other).  You won't have to move aside any shrubbery <br/>
to see these rocks - they're quite visible from the trail.  When I <br/>
found the box, it was simply perched on top of these rocks out in <br/>
the open - I rehid the box just behind the two rocks, and piled a <br/>
couple of small rocks on top of it so that it was better concealed.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps - it's a great little trail, and I'm thankful that <br/>
someone took the time to rehabilitate this box and move it to a <br/>
better location.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone-<br/>
I found this box this week! The log has entries going back to Jan. 1,<br/>
2001-very interesting to see! Sadly, at some point it was wet, so not<br/>
all the stamps are legible, but still a great letterboxing history<br/>
document.<br/>
Once I arrived at the waterfall, I ignored the original clues and used <br/>
the ones Cattail gave, which were extremely helpful, especially the<br/>
part about not having to move any shrubbery to see the rocks. =)<br/>
There's some  confusion about the paces, though.  From the box back to<br/>
the waterfall I took large steps and it was still 30 paces (60<br/>
footfalls) for me. Would've been more had I been walking normally.<br/>
Maybe 15 paces was the distance from the original to the new hiding place?<br/>
The big mystery is, who rescued this box and left it sitting on the<br/>
rocks where Cattail found it? <br/>

letterbox!  Yes, the paces were confusing, but as I recall, the box <br/>
is currently 10-15 paces (20-30 footfalls) down the path from the <br/>
*old* hiding spot.  <br/>
<br/>
Jane (aka J Ra?) was the one who resuscitated this box, although I <br/>
didn't see her stamp in the book, which was a bit of a mystery.  But <br/>
I'm happy that she gave the box some much needed TLC and hid it in a <br/>
better location.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone want to adopt this box and post it on the main <br/>
letterboxing websites and get it out of the basement?  I'm not sure <br/>
how much longer I'll be in the area, or else I would take it on <br/>
myself.<br/>

Have a good week everyone!<br/>
