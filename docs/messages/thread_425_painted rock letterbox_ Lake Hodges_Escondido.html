  Hi,<br>
  We went looking for the painted rock letterbox today. Found a geocache <br>
  that had come lose and replaced it but didn't find the letter box.  I <br>
  think we were in the right location but my daughter ventured off the <br>
  trail to the tree and didn't find anything. I was afraid of poison ivy <br>
  (already had a bad dose this year after trying to plant a letterbox!). <br>
  If anyone can give more detailed clues, we'd love to retry.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi - I've responded to CarolRae in a private email, but I thought <br>
I'd provide some hints on this box for anyone interested.  I'm <br>
pretty sure the box has been moved since Don and Gwen visited four <br>
years ago (see below).<br>
<br>
Ok, so this is a really great trail.  There's a message in the <br>
letterbox basement archives about how the box has been moved from <br>
its original location (which has been swamped with poison ivy), but <br>
I can't seem to find it right now.  When I went to find this box <br>
last month, I found the original spot (which was pretty easy) but <br>
then had a challenging time locating this box at its new spot - <br>
the "revised" clues simply said it's 15 paces down the trail, <br>
underneath a bush between two rocks.<br>
<br>
So here's some clarification on that - go 10-15 paces down the trail <br>
(away from the waterfall, downhill), and the box will be on your <br>
right-hand side.  The bush/shrub that you're looking for is quite <br>
clear - there are two large-melon sized rocks right underneath it <br>
(touching each other).  You won't have to move aside any shrubbery <br>
to see these rocks - they're quite visible from the trail.  When I <br>
found the box, it was simply perched on top of these rocks out in <br>
the open - I rehid the box just behind the two rocks, and piled a <br>
couple of small rocks on top of it so that it was better concealed.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps - it's a great little trail, and I'm thankful that <br>
someone took the time to rehabilitate this box and move it to a <br>
better location.<br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone-<br>
I found this box this week! The log has entries going back to Jan. 1,<br>
2001-very interesting to see! Sadly, at some point it was wet, so not<br>
all the stamps are legible, but still a great letterboxing history<br>
document.<br>
Once I arrived at the waterfall, I ignored the original clues and used <br>
the ones Cattail gave, which were extremely helpful, especially the<br>
part about not having to move any shrubbery to see the rocks. =)<br>
There's some  confusion about the paces, though.  From the box back to<br>
the waterfall I took large steps and it was still 30 paces (60<br>
footfalls) for me. Would've been more had I been walking normally.<br>
Maybe 15 paces was the distance from the original to the new hiding place?<br>
The big mystery is, who rescued this box and left it sitting on the<br>
rocks where Cattail found it? <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Alarch (and everyone else) - I'm glad you found the Painted Rocks <br>
letterbox!  Yes, the paces were confusing, but as I recall, the box <br>
is currently 10-15 paces (20-30 footfalls) down the path from the <br>
*old* hiding spot.  <br>
<br>
Jane (aka J Ra?) was the one who resuscitated this box, although I <br>
didn't see her stamp in the book, which was a bit of a mystery.  But <br>
I'm happy that she gave the box some much needed TLC and hid it in a <br>
better location.<br>
<br>
Does anyone want to adopt this box and post it on the main <br>
letterboxing websites and get it out of the basement?  I'm not sure <br>
how much longer I'll be in the area, or else I would take it on <br>
myself.<br>
<br>
Have a good week everyone!<br>
<br>
Cattail  :)<br>
