I was wondering if you could post the following message for me on <br>
the national group? I can't post without subscribing & can't take <br>
the time to set it up now.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

I am so bummed. I lost my personal stamp. Yes, artTrekker the stamp <br>
is MIA at Duncan's Landing, on the California Coast north of Bodega <br>
Bay. Mim's excellent series Sea Creatures is SO worth visiting, and <br>
if you go to Duncan's Landing (there is a sort of barrier trying to <br>
keep people away from the restrooms--I went through the grass at the <br>
right side, and this seems like a logical place for my poor little <br>
stamp to be lost--it vaporized between the car and the box, a very <br>
short distance), could you please do a little search for me? It is <br>
in a little felt pocket, kind of a grass green one, with the pink <br>
stamp hiding inside. I looked all I could, but my mom had to be back <br>
in Healdsburg to teach a piano lesson and we were already late. <br>
Playing hooky boxing. (Little Shop of Horrors rocks!) I had to carve <br>
a new stamp for Healdsburg Amadeus (my mom) after she lost hers at <br>
Sideways, and the new one is such an improvement, I have to see this <br>
as an opportunity. But I'm kind of attached to my pencil-toting <br>
trekker. I will think up some very nice reward if someone finds it <br>
and gets it back to me!!<br>
<br>
Thanks!!!<br>

WOW!!!! I just got back to Kernville and have passed along the info. <br>
I don't think she is a member of this list but she may contact you <br>
through "Contact the Placer" or through AQ. This should have some <br>
sort of reward-- maybe a cocktail or two overlooking Lake Tahoe?<br>
That certainly is a different kind of X.<br>
