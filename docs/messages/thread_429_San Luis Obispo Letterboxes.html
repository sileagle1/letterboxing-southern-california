I think most of Sir B and JugglerMouse's letterboxes are missing at<br>
this point. There's still a few out there, but your odds of success<br>
are much lower if you hunt down those boxes.<br>
<br>
I'm kind of fond of my Los Osos Oaks series as it was the first series<br>
I ever planted. =) They're all alive and well as of the last time I<br>
checked. The Walking Tour and Bookstore Box are also doing well at<br>
last check. (Well, the Bookstore Box's stamp is broken in two, but<br>
it's still there and findable.)<br>
<br>
Wish I were in the area to show you around a bit, but alas, you must<br>
enjoy the trails without me. =)<br>
<br>
Happy trails!<br>

#3 (I think) because it was too wet to get to. Also the San Luis <br>
Opispo city tour (something like that) was a lot of fun even though we <br>
didn't get the last clue. That will be my first stop next time down. <br>
The butterflies in Pismo Beach were our first find, if you are <br>
planning to hit the beach. A nice view of the beach.<br>
