Well, the new design is great, but I will miss that flower. I think I'm <br>
gonna have to replace my signature stamp, because I can't seem to find <br>
it.  Not being able to find something is not unusual in my house, but I <br>
have a sneaking suspicion that I dropped it somewhere around LA96C.<br>
