boards are basically public and it's not a wise idea to go posting<br/>
personal information for the world to see--especially when there's no<br/>
reason the world needs to see it.<br/>
<br/>
I've deleted the three posts who replied to UK Letterboxer. Contact<br/>
him directly if you wish to participate in the international postal<br/>
box. For one, it keeps your personal information to the smallest<br/>
number of people possible. For a second thing, he posted that message<br/>
to just about every talk list and message board he could find and<br/>
probably doesn't follow every single board very closely, so he could<br/>
have easily overlooked your posts.<br/>
<br/>
But otherwise, have fun! =)<br/>
