and shooting the Salem breeze with Kernville's own Don & Gwen!!!  What <br>
a delightful couple!  It was so neat to finally meet them in person <br>
after all these years.  These two incredible folks have led us on some <br>
really neat adventures up and down the West Coast!  We look forward to <br>
meeting up with them again in the future.<br>
<br>
Letterboxing is such a cool hobby and it's mostly because of the <br>
awesome people who make it happen!  Don & Gwen epitomize that with <br>
their great letterboxes--awesome stamps, exquisite locations and unique <br>
clues!!!  Thank you for the adventures!!!<br>

are going to find a lot of emails regarding their letterboxes. Being<br>
here in Southern California it seems like they have done most of the<br>
planting. Our vacation to Mammoth also involved finding a lot of D &<br>
G's letterboxes. Their clues are always right on, stamps are awesome<br>
and we learn so many interesting things. Hopefully we will have an<br>
opportunity to meet them one day.<br>
