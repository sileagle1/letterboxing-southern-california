                    <div class="plaintext-content">While on vacation on the Central Coast of California this past July <br>
we were letterboxing every chance we could until we ran into a rattle <br>
snake. We then decided to wait until it cooled down. What we were <br>
also finding is that the clues would tell us it's "only a 1/4 mile <br>
hike or a 5 minute stroll" then after a mile down the trail we'd find <br>
the right spot but no letterbox and when you top that off with 90 to <br>
100 degree heat, it's very discouraging.<br>
Can't wait for the fall and cooler weather.<br>
