Hi Folks,<br/>
Gwen &amp; I are back in Kernville from our "Find the cooler weather road <br/>
trip". We did find some cooler weather as well as a few letterboxes. I <br/>
want to appologize to anyone that tried to send us email. Just before <br/>
we left I cranked our spam protection up to max and that created a few <br/>
bounced messages. One thing that was curious though was that <br/>
the "contact the placer function" got through the barrier and we did <br/>
receive updates on several of our letterboxes. Not only did we find <br/>
several letterboxes but left a few in our wake and anyone traveling up <br/>
395 should check the gold country area for a few more. We did replace <br/>
the Fossil Falls letterbox near Little Lake and it has a new location <br/>
and a new stamp. Lee and Nancy should love this image and since both <br/>
the stamp is new and the location at the Falls is new we have added <br/>
this one to our placed count and we now have a 200 P total. Hope <br/>
everyone is having a good summer.<br/>
Don<br/>
<br/>

For our Sweden trip I carved an outline of the USA and made an X where Kernville is located and titled it "Hello Sweden from Kernville".<br/>
Have fun.<br/>
