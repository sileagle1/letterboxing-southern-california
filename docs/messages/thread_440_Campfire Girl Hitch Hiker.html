Does anyone know who is the owner of the Campfire Girl Hitch Hiker?  <br>
We found her at Los Osos Oaks (Memorial Day), but when I tried to <br>
email the owner about her new whereabouts, the email address didn't <br>
work.  The email was letterbox_traveller@yahoogroups.com<br>
<br>
Anyway, she's currently with the Oak Creek Canyon box in Sedona, <br>
Arizona.<br>
<br>
BTW, the boxes in the Morro Bay area are awesome!<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

I believe the address you used was the one for the HH list. There are so many HHers out there it is difficult to stay current. If you go to the Travelers Yahoo Group and scroll down to the link for Pete & Wanda's list you can find out where that HHer has been. FYI it is best only to post where the HHer has been, rather than the spot you left it. That is unless you run across "Honor Liberty".<br>
<br>
Morro Bay and SLO are really great boxing destinations.<br>
