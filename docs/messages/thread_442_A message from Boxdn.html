Hello Everyone,<br>
<br>
Dropping a quick note to let yall know that I am fine ten fingers and<br>
ten toes. I was sheltered just north of Pearl River Louisiana with my<br>
brother at his store. We have been doing far better than the 1,000's<br>
that were stuck in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. The neighbors have<br>
all come together to help one another out and to watch each others<br>
back.JamesDillon ( n0wka ) lives just up the road from here and I<br>
would<br>
tink he is ok too; maybe some tree damage. Wensday I plan to go back<br>
to<br>
my home to see what is left and retrieve anything that is salvagable.<br>
I<br>
know my Suburban was flooded but it has full coverage and as long as<br>
the roof didn't blow off my apartment my things should be fine (unless<br>
I was looted).<br>
<br>
I have read alot of the messages posted on the Lb talk lists and want<br>
to thank everyone for their prayers and concerns. Please keep praying<br>
for the rest of the other displaced people. If your local areas are<br>
doing water, food, clothes, etc... drives please donate what you can,<br>
every little bit helps when you have nothing, if you donate money make<br>
sure it goes to the Katrina Huricane funds.<br>
<br>
I will post later when I have the time to tell more. Thank you all<br>
again and God Bless.<br>
<br>
Boxdn,<br>

ATTENTION!!! Mark Pepe. Please post this message to Lb talklists. I<br>
