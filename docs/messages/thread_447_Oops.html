It worked okay when I received via individual emails. It just didn't work on the chatlist page.<br>
FYI I just received a note about the semi mystery box at El Dorado it is alive and well. The Babe Lure is also okay, it was just the clerk that had no clue.<br>
Gwen is in the process of carving her third stamp. The replacement for Brush Creek. We went up to Box #2 of the Dragon today and replaced the container.<br>
Added a few for my quail dinner. Tomarrow Mad Dawg will get the replacement box.<br>
