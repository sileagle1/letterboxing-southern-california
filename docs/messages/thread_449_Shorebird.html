I'll have to visit it some time anyway. :)<br/>

How funny.  My wife and I just went looking for it a second time last<br/>
Tuesday, but to no avail.  It's a beautiful area, but it gets a<br/>
surprising amount of foot traffic, considering that current<br/>
construction makes it pretty inaccessible.<br/>
<br/>
That makes the Signal Hill box just about the oldest surviving box in<br/>
the area, doesn't it?  At least, that's listed on LBNA.<br/>

You can check with the Forest Service for outfitter info. Once you book and get up here then you should try to find out which guides on the trip have the most experience and make sure that is the boat you get into. This year first and second year guides might have a few problems.<br/>
