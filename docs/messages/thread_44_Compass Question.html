                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now I have used a compass since Viet Nam and yet I drew a blank about <br/>
some markings that parallel my degree scale. The numbers run through <br/>
64 (that at the 360 or due north location). <br/>
<br/>
I told JugglerMouse that those were radians but upon research, a <br/>
circle is 2 PI radians. That would eliminate 64 radians in a circle. <br/>
2 times PI would be 6.283  Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
So, there I am. Low carb PI or nothing. What do you think those 64 <br/>
things are?<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I am now the proud possessor of a US SANDY (Stockard and Yard) <br/>
military issue, tritium illuminated, compass. Darn it! JugglerMouse's <br/>
should be here today or I may lose mine. I know, she would <br/>
only "borrow it" for a juggling prop.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

who is mapping out Meadow Park for hiding things today for the SLO <br/>
Stamping in the Meadow Oct 4th event <br/>
(okay, with JugglerMouse and Ash Raven)<br/>
