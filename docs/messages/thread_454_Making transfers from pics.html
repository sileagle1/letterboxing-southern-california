I have done the HB pencil and that work "OK" but difficult to "pencil<br>

Hi Dan<br>
<br>
Usually I use the soft lead pencil tranfer technique, but found on <br>
really intricate images the acetone transfer method works best. FYI <br>
not all nail polish has acetone. Anyway after obtaining the image I <br>
want I print it on our HP printer/scanner. I then scour the stamp <br>
material(PZKut original A grade, don't know if it works on the new <br>
orange stuff)with a wetted with acetone paper towel. This changes the <br>
stamp surface slightly and makes it just a tad gummy. I then place the <br>
copy face down and rub it like a pencil transfer. I usually go over <br>
the transfered image with a ballpoint to make sure that it doesn't <br>
blurr.<br>
The Painted Cave stamp wasn't done with any of those techniques, but <br>
it was a direct draw on the material and carve. It was simple enough <br>
that I could get away with that technique.<br>
I use acetone to clean up stamps and also prepare the back surface for <br>
glue, and you can get it in 1 qt cans at you local hardware store.<br>
