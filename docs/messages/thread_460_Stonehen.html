had a logbook.<br/>
<br/>
I kept thinking there MUST be a better way to get to the rock formation <br/>
and looked for an easier way coming back BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!<br/>
<br/>
The views from up there is spectacular, so if any of you ever get to <br/>
Central California and want to find it, bring thick clothing, high <br/>
boots and a camera!!<br/>

&gt; I can't believe you did that as your first find. That box was a pain<br/>
&gt; in the you-know-what to get to. I kept thinking I had to be missing<br/>
&gt; something. There had to be an easier way to get the box. But noooo....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The brush does indeed eat small animals. And NOT a box I would<br/>
&gt; recommend for a first-timer! It had the potential to scare a<br/>
&gt; letterboxer off for life! =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pretty cool, though, huh? =)<br/>
