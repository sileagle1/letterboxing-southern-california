From: Michael Ann Powers (michael@rancholosalamitos.com)<br>
<br>
I am the events coordinator at Rancho Los Alamitos Historic Ranch &<br>
Gardens. I am very interested in letter boxing and I am considering<br>
presenting an event to host letterboxers and to introduce folks to the<br>
adventure of the hunt. I want to find a local Long Beach person who<br>
might like to help me understand the particulars of boxing and give<br>
suggestions for a successful event, since I have no first hand<br>
experience with boxing.<br>
<br>
I would like the event to coinside with International Museum Day, May<br>
18 and America Museum Week. The theme for museum week is "Museums and<br>
Young People"<br>
<br>
Our beautiful site will be a perfect location for a day of treasure<br>
hunting. Hope to hear from you! You can find us at<br>
www.rancholosalamitos.com<br>

I'd love to see this happen, if only to have another legitimate place<br>
where the property owners actually encourage letterboxing on their<br>
property. =) Anyone want to help out? I'd do it except I'm not in the<br>
area. (Just a technicality, I know, but still.....)<br>
<br>
Happy trails!<br>
