going to try calling this Wednesday (Rancho hours Wed. thru Sunday, <br/>
1pm to 3pm)and try and set up a meeting for early February. If anyone <br/>
is interested in joining us for the meeting or in participating on <br/>
event day please post a note here. Apparantly the event is scheduled <br/>
for the end of May, and Gwen &amp; I will be on the east coast. This could <br/>
be a great opportunity for a SoCal gathering on event day. If you have <br/>
never been to the Rancho then you have missed a super example of early <br/>
California history.<br/>
