I'm in complete agreement on the too public comment. I think the <br/>
biggest hurdle would be too small of an area and too many people.<br/>
I could see this as a temporary letterbox plants somewhat like a <br/>
gathering with temporary letterboxes. I did call today instead of <br/>
waiting until Wednesday. I left a message on her voice mail and called <br/>
her at home (her message gave me her home number)and left a message.<br/>
We will meet with her, show her some examples, maybe take her over to <br/>
LB State and let her find a few and see what transpires. I will post <br/>
the info on meeting prior to meeting in case anyone wishes to join us.<br/>
