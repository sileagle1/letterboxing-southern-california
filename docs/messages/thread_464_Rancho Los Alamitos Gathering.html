Programs and Special Events coordinator for Rancho Los Alamitos in <br>
Long Beach. She is interested in hosting a "Gathering" where the <br>
public can be introduced to Letterboxing. A tentative date is May <br>
7th. In our conversation I expressed our concerns about too much <br>
publicity and the numbers of attendees, but I believe these concerns <br>
can be overcome. While this first conversation was fairly basic, the <br>
concepts of several temporary letterboxes, carving clinics, logbook <br>
construction, clue writing and other facets of our `game' were <br>
discussed as part of the event. We established a face-to-face <br>
meeting date on Monday, February 6, 10am at the Rancho. I suggested <br>
that she should accompany us on finding a few letterboxes, and since <br>
the Rancho is close to Long Beach State, that might be a good <br>
starting point. Gwen & I are planning on heading to Virginia for the <br>
end of May, so we may or may not have a problem with attending the <br>
gathering? Also since we are generally in Kernville these days it <br>
would be a much better idea if someone local step up and volunteer <br>
to be the coordinator. If anyone wishes to attend the Feb. 6th <br>
meeting and/or be the local coordinator please post that info here <br>
on the SoCal chat list. If you want to volunteer to handle a carving <br>
clinic, hide a temporary letterbox, handle a clue writing clinic, or <br>
any other aspect of Letterboxing, then please post that as well.<br>
If there are any changes to either date or the times I'll try my <br>
best to post adequate notice.<br>
