Thanks, Don.  Most of my early box finds were one's you and Gwen did<br>
(and two from Chowder).  I was inspired to get creative.  After months<br>
of thinking about it, I finally put out some boxes of my own, then<br>
became a member of LbNA.org and posted them.  I was surprised and<br>
delighted by the immediate response.  <br>
<br>
After posting the first three, I realized I'd forgotten that I wanted<br>
to put the stamp and it's name on the first page of the logbook, as<br>
was common in letterboxes I'd found.  But when I went back to them,<br>
all three had already been found, and one had six visitors in the<br>
first 48 hours after I posted the clues.<br>
<br>
So I went back and stamped the other three before I posted their<br>
clues, which is when I noticed the 20,000 landmark.  I then recieved a<br>
few emails about it, and realized I'd better get on this discussion<br>
group, since letterboxing was obviously a much more interactive and<br>
vibrant culture then I'd realized.<br>
<br>
This is my first message, and I think the first thing you'll all learn<br>
about me is that I'm terribly long-winded.  Brevity was never my<br>
strong suit.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the warm welcome.<br>

p.s. Ignore the peacheseasy name.  This is an old yahoo account I used<br>
to use for a band I worked with, and it was quicker than signing up to<br>
yahoo again.<br>

Welcome to the SoCal group. We aren't quite as talky as the other groups, but you will have the laidback SoCal influence here. One word of caution about the mainlist at LBNA it can get in an uproar occasionally. Another good reference list is the Newboxers list.<br>
We do have some cool features on this list and if you will check out the links function you will see some of those features.<br>
BTW we are still looking for a volunteer to coordinate the Rancho gathering in May. There won't be that much to do, and Gwen & I would do it, but since we are living in Kernville it would be better to have a local letterboxer.<br>
