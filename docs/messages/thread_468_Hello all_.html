  I just wanted to say hello and introduce myself.  My husband and I  just discovered letterboxing this week and I am happy to announce that  we have found our first and second boxes today!  We had a  wonderful time searching for The Cavan Girls 100 Acre Woods  boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
  We look forward to getting to know everyone and finding some great boxes!<br/>

I remember finding those two boxes.  Were you able to retreive that <br/>
second box without getting the attention of the large dogs in the <br/>
yard behind it (I believe they were Great Danes)?<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the adventure.<br/>

Welcome to Lost Lenore and Uberwalder.It looks like the SoCal group <br/>
has two more new addicted members.<br/>
<br/>
We received a note from another letterboxer this morning advising <br/>
that our 'Real 49er' at LB State had some weird code written in the <br/>
log as well as some obcenities and they were reluctant to tear out <br/>
the pages of the logbook. Gwen and I feel that once we place a <br/>
letterbox it becomes a public(letterboxing) property and if any <br/>
finder sees that it needs some maintenance please feel as though you <br/>
can deal with it. We always take additional supplies with us when we <br/>
are out searching for boxes and everyone else might want to consider <br/>
doing the same. We will be back in the Long Beach area around the <br/>
first of Feb and can take care of the problem. We do appreciate the <br/>
notice that the letterboxer sent us as well as other notes from <br/>
finders.It is always good to hear from finders. It was surprising <br/>
that this box was vandalised as it seems that only 1 in 5 <br/>
letterboxers has been able to find this box.<br/>
<br/>
Still looking for anyone that wants to help out at the Rancho.<br/>
<br/>
BTW we were first finders in 3 of Lee &amp; Nancy's letterboxes in the <br/>
Apple Valley area last week. Great stamps! One of the boxes had been <br/>
there for over a year. This is the time of year to make a high <br/>
desert trip.<br/>

That's so funny.  I've gotten my sister-in-law into boxing when she<br/>
was down here over the holidays.  She lives in Apple Valley.  She had<br/>
told me that she went looking for those but was unsuccessful.  She<br/>
couldn't find the flag on Bell Mountain.  I'm not sure why she had<br/>
trouble deciphering the gateway sign.  I read your post and gave her a<br/>
call, so now she's inspired to try a little harder.<br/>
