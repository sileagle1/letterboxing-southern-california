<br/>
Always think "Stealth". Consider retrieval and rehide of a letterbox as one of the most secretive things you can do.<br/>
Here are a few links to some sites that you can peruse and gain some knowledge on Letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Don<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing.org:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html<br/>
<br/>
Silent Doug's site:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/<br/>
Doug probably has the best info site on Hitchhikers and links to regional chatlists.<br/>
<br/>
AtlasQuest:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/<br/>
Ryan has a link set up "Code of Conduct" that is really good for all<br/>
boxers to read<br/>
<br/>
newboxers' group:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
Where there is no dumb question, and is "the" place for many<br/>
newletterboxers.<br/>
