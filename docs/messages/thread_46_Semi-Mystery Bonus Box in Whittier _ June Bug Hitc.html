                    <div class="plaintext-content">My wife, French Hen, and I rolled out of bed early this morning and, <br>
even though it was a work day, decided the weekend needed to be <br>
extended.  So I called in a vacation day and we hot-footed it to the <br>
city of Whittier, where Jam & Jelly have recently re-planted <br>
their "Semi-Mystery Box" along with a bonus box.  I'd already found <br>
the first plant, along with a bonus box with a stamp carved by <br>
Jelly.  How any civilian ever found the original box is beyond me; <br>
seemed like such a good hiding place, but they do have extensive <br>
upkeep at this park, which we saw ample evidence of early this <br>
morning with all the leaf-blowers, and people wading in streams <br>
fishing out stuff, and sprinklers on, etc.  My wife, who is new to <br>
the sport, read out the clues, and in short order found the mystery <br>
box and . . . A HITCHHIKER!!  She was thrilled; it was the June Bug <br>
HH started by Camp Fire Lady and planted in this box by Purple Iris.  <br>
Now on to the bonus box.  Early this morning, the lawn sprinklers <br>
were soaking the area of the bonus box, but, not to be daunted, I <br>
zigged and zagged between the water jets, and found the bonus box <br>
with a minimum of drenching (I don't think this qualifies for the LB <br>
Purple Heart, but it was cold).  Loved the location of this letterbox <br>
J&J, but I'll bet that Jelly couldn't have planted it without being <br>
on Jam's shoulders--French Hen and I are first stamp!! Thanks for a <br>
memorable morning playing hooky from work.<br>

It is always good to get your reports. We like the box<br>
#2, it's easy to check on. We will see how long it<br>
will last! Did you ever make it back to the second box<br>
at the Strange Stamp Series? Eye bet you will like the<br>
stamp! Wow 60 finds that's great!!<br>
Have fun...<br>
