                    <div class="plaintext-content">My wife, French Hen, and I rolled out of bed early this morning and, <br/>
even though it was a work day, decided the weekend needed to be <br/>
extended.  So I called in a vacation day and we hot-footed it to the <br/>
city of Whittier, where Jam &amp; Jelly have recently re-planted <br/>
their "Semi-Mystery Box" along with a bonus box.  I'd already found <br/>
the first plant, along with a bonus box with a stamp carved by <br/>
Jelly.  How any civilian ever found the original box is beyond me; <br/>
seemed like such a good hiding place, but they do have extensive <br/>
upkeep at this park, which we saw ample evidence of early this <br/>
morning with all the leaf-blowers, and people wading in streams <br/>
fishing out stuff, and sprinklers on, etc.  My wife, who is new to <br/>
the sport, read out the clues, and in short order found the mystery <br/>
box and . . . A HITCHHIKER!!  She was thrilled; it was the June Bug <br/>
HH started by Camp Fire Lady and planted in this box by Purple Iris.  <br/>
Now on to the bonus box.  Early this morning, the lawn sprinklers <br/>
were soaking the area of the bonus box, but, not to be daunted, I <br/>
zigged and zagged between the water jets, and found the bonus box <br/>
with a minimum of drenching (I don't think this qualifies for the LB <br/>
Purple Heart, but it was cold).  Loved the location of this letterbox <br/>
J&amp;J, but I'll bet that Jelly couldn't have planted it without being <br/>
on Jam's shoulders--French Hen and I are first stamp!! Thanks for a <br/>
memorable morning playing hooky from work.<br/>

It is always good to get your reports. We like the box<br/>
#2, it's easy to check on. We will see how long it<br/>
will last! Did you ever make it back to the second box<br/>
at the Strange Stamp Series? Eye bet you will like the<br/>
stamp! Wow 60 finds that's great!!<br/>
Have fun...<br/>
