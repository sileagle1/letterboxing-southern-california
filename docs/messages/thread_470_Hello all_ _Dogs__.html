  I remember finding those two boxes.  Were you able to retreive that <br/>
  second box without getting the attention of the large dogs in the <br/>
  yard behind it (I believe they were Great Danes)?<br/>
<br/>
  Enjoy the adventure.<br/>

but did not find the 2 Hundred Acre Woods boxes.  Those dogs had <br/>
Grinch totally spooked and even Grumpy was a bit uneasy.  The area was <br/>
so overgrown and the dogs were so persistently loud, we gave up after <br/>
about 15 minutes.  We kept anticipating dog bits, tetanus shots, and <br/>
total embarrassment.  We're glad to learn the boxes are still there <br/>
and that others have been more successful.<br/>
