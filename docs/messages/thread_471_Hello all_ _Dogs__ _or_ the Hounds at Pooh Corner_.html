&gt; When we were in Southern California a few months ago we searched for <br/>
&gt; but did not find the 2 Hundred Acre Woods boxes.  Those dogs had <br/>
&gt; Grinch totally spooked and even Grumpy was a bit uneasy.  The area was <br/>
&gt; so overgrown and the dogs were so persistently loud, we gave up after <br/>
&gt; about 15 minutes.  We kept anticipating dog bits, tetanus shots, and <br/>
&gt; total embarrassment.  We're glad to learn the boxes are still there <br/>
&gt; and that others have been more successful.<br/>

recall they were tied, though I don't remember the fence.  They were <br/>
loud and sounded very close.  Someone else who has been there recently <br/>
would be better to advise you about bringing your own dog.<br/>

At any rate, there seemed to be a lot of barking and  howling going on, so I wouldn't recommend bringing an exciteable pooch  with you.<br/>

  Good Luck!<br/>
