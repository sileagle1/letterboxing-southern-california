                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Hello all!<br>
    <br>
  I am getting ready to place my first box and I have a few questions  about stamping etiquette.  I wanted to ask this group since I  presume that each area has it's own "culture" when it comes to these  things.<br>
  <br>
 In my limited boxing experience (2 months now) I have  stamped the last or next to last page in 3 different box  journals.  My husband and I each have our own stamp, and write our  own comments, but we always fit them both on to one page so as not to  waste space.  Looking back through the journals I have noticed  several occasions where it appears that a family of 4 or 5 have given  each of their young children a page of their own to stamp.  So one  party takes up 5 pages in a journal.  Sadly, most of the page is  just blank space with only a stamp and first name.  I'm seeing  this as wasted paper and space since the stamps and signatures could  easily fit on one page.  This seems particularly sad when the  placer went to the trouble of hand making the journal.  <br>
  <br>
  So here are my   questions:<br>
  <br>
  1. What is the etiquette for an unrelated party going back and using  the other half of a page to sign in?  (This would put two boxers  on one page).  This also goes for using the back side of a page if  your sure the stamp won't "bleed" through.<br>
  <br>
  2. Would it be offensive for the placer of a box to suggest in the clues that parties share a page when possible?<br>
  <br>
  Any comments would be appreciated.<br>
  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Lost Lenore,<br>
 I have  found many boxes where multiple parties stamp in on the same<br>
page, usually after the pages have all been stamped once. <br>
In your own box  it seems perfectly appropriate to request that people<br>
try to conserve space when stamping in, particularly if the log is<br>
small. I think I've seen clues  where the placer made a similar request.<br>
Thanks to all for the advice re: the hounds. I'll have to sneak out<br>
when my dog's not looking some day, to hunt for those boxes! I tried<br>
last week, but he gave me those "eyes" :)<br>
Happy Boxing!<br>

Here is my answer to your questions, but first I will tell you that Gwen & I carry extra logbooks just in case the box we find has a logbook problem. I think having every member of a family stamp in on multiple pages is a little self centered. Gwen and I try to keep to one page, maybe front and back,when we can. If you are placing your letterbox then set it up the way you wish. We have crammed our personal stamp next to others so I don't see the problem.<br>
