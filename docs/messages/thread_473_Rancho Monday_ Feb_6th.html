Here is some of the things discussed at the meeting in Long Beach. <br/>
In attendance were representatives from Rancho Los Alamitos, Rancho <br/>
Los Cerritos, and Long Beach Museum of Art. Gwen &amp; I represented the <br/>
letterboxing community. A fairly in depth description of <br/>
letterboxing was given, as well as a discussion on how the <br/>
letterboxing could be used for a special event with temp boxes  and <br/>
how a permanent box could be set up at both Ranchos. The Art Museum <br/>
has different goals, and they may not want to participate. We left <br/>
some lockable metal boxes for both Ranchos as they will eventually <br/>
will want a permanent on site letterbox. The lockable boxes will <br/>
help eliminate vandalism, and access will be provided through the <br/>
clues(combo locks). Their concept of having a gathering in May has <br/>
been put off until October. At this gathering they would like <br/>
several temp boxes with clues handed out and the general public <br/>
invited. We realize and advised that this tended to be opposite of <br/>
what we (letterboxers) generally think of as a gathering due to the <br/>
stealth aspect of LB, but felt that with carving clinics, clue <br/>
writing clinics and other informational areas it still would be a <br/>
worthwhile project. We did advise how we generally shun publicity, <br/>
but even though they want publicity it could work. The only clue <br/>
sheets that would be handed out would be for those temps for the <br/>
Museums or Ranchos. Anyone wanting to look for more letterboxes <br/>
would have to go on line and find them there. This would help with <br/>
newboxers having a negative impact on those letterboxes currently <br/>
planted in the surrounding area. The Representatives will be getting <br/>
back to us and we will report on this as things develop.<br/>
