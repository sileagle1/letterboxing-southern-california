                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!  It's been a while since I have been around here and I see<br/>
that you have all been busy what with the Rancho thing, a bunch of new<br/>
users and a ton of new boxes!<br/>
<br/>
As for me, I have a new baby in my house as of October so that has<br/>
been keeping me really busy.  My apologies to anyone who has tried to<br/>
contact me via e-mail that I did not respond to.  Between being busy<br/>
with the baby, all the spam and all the messages from the letterbox<br/>
groups, I'm sure some have been lost in the shuffle.<br/>
<br/>
I have a little bit more time for some letterboxing now and I took a<br/>
chance this morning to enter "The Bermuda Triangle" in Cerritos.  It<br/>
feels good to be back in action!<br/>
<br/>
The next thing I need to do is to check up on all of my boxes and see<br/>
how they are doing.  I have a couple of missing box reports filed away<br/>
somewhere in my e-mail inbox that I need to follow up on.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Rancho letterboxing event, I will probably not be in a<br/>
position to coordinate the event but I can help out with a workshop on<br/>
something.  I am thinking maybe clue writing.  I also think that Bob's<br/>
(at least  I think it was Bob) idea of making stamps out of Fun Foam<br/>
shapes cut with scissors and glued to wood blocks might be a good<br/>
workshop to do for that event as it will give people who are terrified<br/>
of stamp carving a way to make their own signature stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Well, back to the salt mines.  I'll try to pay more attention to the<br/>
group now and keep up with stuff in the future.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome back!!!! Gwen &amp; I have been wondering about you. In our <br/>
meeting with Michael at the Rancho she said that she tried to find <br/>
the Tardis, but was fairly certain that it was missing. It looks <br/>
like the Rancho get together is on hold for now, but I might nudge <br/>
them after a while.<br/>
