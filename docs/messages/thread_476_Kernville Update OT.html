                    <div class="plaintext-content">Flathead. Only two of the boxes need a screwdriver. This was a test on empty paint cans purchased at Home Depot. The Grumpy Grinches found that one of them had rusted so we replaced it with Tupperware. The Princess and daughter are coming to da 'Ville this week for some power boxing. Some day I should enlighten you about the river study that turned me off on your employer. <br>
One thing that I find interesting  is the concept of charging us here in the Valley at resort prices for power while generating(industrial) power from a river, that if it were allowed to flow without removal of the water, would bring more people to the resort. Kinda difficult to figure out.<br>
