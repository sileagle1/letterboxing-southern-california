Sounds like compass directions :)   There are links to compass info on<br/>
Silent Doug's website, and a tutorial on Atlas Quest. (See the "Links"<br/>
menu on LBNA). Hmm, could be a good homeschooling activity...<br/>
Have a great trip! <br/>

Clues with degrees refer to compass headings. In some cases, you may<br/>
not need the compass as the degrees give a general idea as to the<br/>
direction you should go (i.e., follow the trail at 130 degrees).<br/>
<br/>
A rough guide to compass direction is to remember that north is 0<br/>
degrees (or 360 degrees since there are 360 degrees in a circle). <br/>
East is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, and west is 270 degrees. <br/>
This may be helpful for the rough directions I mentioned above but it<br/>
would be most helpful to have a compass.<br/>
