Mystery.  Glad to hear she's atill alive and well.  You're one up on us with <br/>
the Bonus Box.  I don't know whether we were looking in the wrong spot or <br/>
whether it was just too dark the evening we visited, but we weren't able to locate <br/>
it.  Glad to hear it's still there.  When Jelly Bean and G-String get their <br/>
stamps carved, we plan to go back and try again.<br/>
