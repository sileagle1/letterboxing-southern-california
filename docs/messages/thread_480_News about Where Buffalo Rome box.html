fellow fortunately, but there was an older gentleman who came along, <br>
set down a chair, took out a drawing pad and started sketching the <br>
buffalo chip while I was standing on top of it!  I had to leave and <br>
come back several hours later, after he'd finally finished.  If you <br>
ever see a sketch/painting of the chip with a person standing on top <br>
of it, let me know. ;)<br>

Anyway, I should probably introduce myself before I ramble any <br>
further.  My name's Tracy, trailname Tdyans.  I discovered <br>
letterboxing just a few weeks ago and fell instantly in love with the <br>
whole idea.  I'd already joined newboxers and the big list, but I was <br>
happy to discover this one today-- it'll be nice to chat with other <br>
boxers around this area (not to mention be kept up to date on <br>
important stuff like this warning!)<br>

Welcome Tdyans<br>
<br>
I think you will find that while this chatlist isn't real busy, it <br>
is much calmer than the big list. It tends to be as mellow as the <br>
newboxers list.<br>
