I've also replaced the Eaton Canyon Letterbox, which I had removed for <br/>
first aid but hadn't previously replaced because of poison oak growth <br/>
at the site. The location of this box is very pretty, but is absolutely <br/>
surrounded by poison oak. I would never have put a box here myself, but <br/>
this is the original placement.<br/>

Yep, I thought of you when I put back the Eaton Canyon LB.  The streams <br/>
are very crossable. I been wanting to replace my Coyote Canyon and <br/>
Meadow letterbox as well, so if you wait awhile you may be able to get <br/>
four letterboxes on one trip.  It'll be getting hot in the canyon soon, <br/>
though, but the wildflowers will be out.<br/>
