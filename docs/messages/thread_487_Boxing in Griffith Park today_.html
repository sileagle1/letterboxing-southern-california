Griffith Park today.  Found Lee &amp; Nancy's "Feed the Children" box--<br/>
really beautiful carving--you'd love it, D&amp;G.  It's hidden amongst a <br/>
lot of poison oak and stinging nettle, but hey this is Southern <br/>
California, what do you expect, tulips?  I confirmed that the first box <br/>
in my Amir's Garden Series is missing, which had been reported to me.  <br/>
This box was hidden in tall, thick grass . . . which has since been <br/>
completely chopped down to the ground (heavy sigh).  I'm happy to <br/>
report, however, that Q's LB, hidden nearby, is still there, as is the <br/>
second box in my series.  The survival of my second box surprises me, <br/>
since it is hidden in a garden where they do things like water and <br/>
weed; I would have thought they'd have found it for sure.  It's had a <br/>
lot of visitors.  Oh, and I found a watch!<br/>
