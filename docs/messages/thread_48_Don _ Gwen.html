I have a question about your Seal Beach Town Tour series of boxes.  <br/>
Basically, what I'd like to ask is permission to steal your brilliant <br/>
idea!  :)<br/>
<br/>
There's a cool mountain town about 30 miles west of Denver, that is <br/>
just screaming for a town tour of its own.  It's an old mining town - <br/>
turned tourist trap - apres' ski area.  I really like to replicate <br/>
your clue system (using historic town plaques and decoding).  <br/>
First ... would you mind if I did that, keeping in mind that <br/>
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery ... *wink*<br/>
And second ... would you contact me offlist to give me a bit of a <br/>
hand with clue construction? (provided you are willing, of course)<br/>
<br/>
Autumn<br/>
(snow season has already begun ... I'm going to be carving all winter <br/>
long, I suspect)<br/>

you can reach me at autumn at shadowslight dot com<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Autumn,<br/>
We wish we could take credit for the concept for the Seal Beach Town Tour clues, but we stole Ryan Carpenter's idea for the clues(see San Luis Obispo, Ca."Walking Tour"). We did give you more bang for the buck,7 LBs as compared to Ryan's one very little, but very prized stamp. You could contact Ryan, there are links to his web site from any of his clues. He is due to be off the AT shortly, and my guess he will be flattered to have you ask for permission.Make sure you give him credit as we did in the clues. Maybe we can visit your boxes soon ,Gwen's sister lives in Ft. Collins and she has been wanting us to visit. We caught your post on 9/18 and have no clue when we can get on line again. There is no local Earthlink number in Brookings, Ore.and we have to call Portland ,Ore. to get on line. We are due back in Kernville Oct.1 and you can reach us off list at foxsecurity@earthlink.net . Hopefully we can post this prior. For those Socal LBers reading this the North Coast is beautiful and we planted one in Eureka,and another in a fantastic Fern Canyon near Orick, Ca. while finding a Funhogs box at Skunk Cabbage,Katpaus' Hendy Park,Double saj&amp; Ol Blue's Redcrest Fairyland and just finished a hike outside of Brookings, Ore. The best location is the "Oasis" letterbox and really  should not be missed if you are going to be in the area!!!!!!!!!!Don &amp; Gwen<br/>
