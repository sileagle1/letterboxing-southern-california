  <br>
  Uberwalder and I have just placed our first two boxes, and I've finally  got the website up and running.  I'm bursting with excitement!  These two are part of a series of boxes call Wizardry 101.  All of them will be located in Southern California.  We attempted  to create an interesting story-line behind this "quest." Plus, there  will be something extra special for those who complete the quest and  attain the last box.  Uberwalder and I would love feedback on the  website and the boxes.  So please send us a private e-mail and/or  write on list and tell us what you think!    Thanks to everyone in advance!<br>
  <br>
    MY WEBSITE (our clues are here)<br>
  You can also find the clues on LBNA and Atlasquest under WIZ 101 or Wizardry 101 with Lost Lenore as the placer.   <br>
  <br>
  Happy boxing!<br>
