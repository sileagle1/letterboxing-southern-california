Is there any special way to find you and Akkaia (or do I have to <br/>
figure that out on my own)?  <br/>

My very good friend is a puppy raiser for GDA. She just turned in her <br/>
puppy this past Saturday. We are totally going to her graduation -the <br/>
puppy's that is...or actually, I guess she will be a full grown dog by <br/>
then! Anyway- in between tears of joy (and yes, there shall be many) <br/>
we will look for you and your puppy and the box.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for planting this box to remind all us of the great things GDA <br/>
does!<br/>
