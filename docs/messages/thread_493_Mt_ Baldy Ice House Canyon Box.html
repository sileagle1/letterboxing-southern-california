<br/>
  I'm wondering if anyone has successfully found the Ice House Canyon box  in Mt. Baldy Village?  My hubby and I have attempted it twice now  and always get stuck at the same clue.  It seems way to generic,  but we are probably missing something.  I already e-mailed the  placer and did not get a response.  So if anyone has found or  attempted this box I could really use a hint about what the fallen  giant is supposed to be (there are so many fallen trees in that place  it seems like that can't be what it refers too).  Thanks everyone  :)<br/>

Yep we found it but this may not be of much help as it was in early <br/>
2001. When we found it we realized that we went waaaay too far on <br/>
the trail. As I recall the giant was pretty close to where the trail <br/>
started going up and it was right along side of the trail(?).Not a <br/>
very far hike at all. You then cut off and down to the right, cross <br/>
a creek(?) and look in the corner of a foundation. When we were 1st <br/>
finders we also left a tupperware as the Squirrel had everything in <br/>
ziplocs. I'm not sure greysquirrel is still letterboxing and she is <br/>
back east somewhere so she may not be of much help anyway. If you <br/>
are successful please post your success here so that we all know.<br/>
