This year the upper Kern should be peaking at 6 or 7 thousand CFS. The lake level is up considerably and some predict a spillway party this year. The only time I've seen it go over the spillway was in 1983 and that made the lower  unrunnable for commercial trips, but it was a very quick run for those that did get to boat it. It only took about 2 hours on the water to do the regular two day run.<br/>

  GRRRRRRR. . . Well, I guess my brain was scrambled by the heat.  Who <br/>
  knows--downed tree , up tree, left tree, right tree.  I just know that <br/>
  one day soon I'm gonna git me that letterbox, then I'm gonna jump into <br/>
  that beautiful creek and cool off.<br/>

  &gt; Fish hooks are in the eye of the beholder. Once you see it, it will <br/>
  be a head slapper! Do the clues say it is a downed tree? I don't think <br/>
  so.<br/>
