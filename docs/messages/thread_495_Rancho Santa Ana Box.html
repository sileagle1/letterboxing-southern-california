This is listed on the old LbNA site, and may not have been switched over. I'm not sure if it can be found in the basement as well. Greysquirrel had 3 letterboxes listed together. Ice House, Rancho Santa Ana, and Bonelli Park(?) The Bonelli park one went missing right after she planted the box and Gwen & I really scoured the area for it.<br>

  Does anyone know if this box still exits? i was in the gardens today <br>
  and they have changed the entrance to the grounds, so the clues would <br>
  be different. I looked on the LB Org. site but didn't find the box <br>
  listed. At any rate. If it still is there the clues would need to be <br>
  changed. Purple Iris. P.S. It's beautiful in the garden. <br>
