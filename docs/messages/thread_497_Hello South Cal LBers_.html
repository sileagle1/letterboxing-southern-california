Yes, I'm one of the people reporting it missing.  I'm sorry, but we<br/>
dug in the sand a couple feet all around the area it was supposed to<br/>
be, but to no avail.  And in the process, we already observed several<br/>
children imitating our digging, in spite of our efforts to be<br/>
discreet.  The idea is nice, but there is just too much constant foot<br/>
traffic all around Venice Beach to make hiding a box feasable.<br/>
<br/>
However, my friend Naughty Zoot did find your Day Of The Dead<br/>
letterbox on one of her solo ventures, and I'm SOOO jealous of the<br/>
stamp, but have yet to make the trip to find it myself.  For any of<br/>
you on here who've thought about it but haven't, go find this<br/>
beautiful stamp.<br/>

  I had a lot of fun with that Day of the Dead box.  Thanks!  I hope that you can make it there soon.  The cemetery is really cool!  Lots of folks there celebrating as the box was planted during the Dia De Los Muertos last year.  Full meriachi (I know I killed the spelling) bands and all.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks again.  Aljan<br/>
