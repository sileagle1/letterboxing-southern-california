I've been out of the game since the beginning of the year with all the <br>

get back in! I'm moving to the San Diego area, so I'll be trying to <br>
plant some new boxes there.  In the meantime, would anyone be <br>
interested in adopting my only surviving LB here in LA, the Nike <br>

  Hope to see you on the trails!<br>

I'd be happy to adopt your LA-96 letterbox.  Per my logbook, I was the <br>
first stamper on 5/29/05, and thought this site was way cool.  I think <br>
that this is more Q's neck of the woods, though, so she seems a more <br>
likely adopter.<br>
