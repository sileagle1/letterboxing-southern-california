We had a great time today working out your clues for Seal Beach <br/>
series! We had a little problem with the first box's clues. We think <br/>
we got a little confused on finding the second plaque?<br/>
We Found #2 &amp; #3 and had to call it a day. Jelly turned 11 on the 6th <br/>
the same day you planted the boxes and she was first finder on the <br/>
two boxes. She got a kick out of the boxes being placed on her <br/>
birthday! <br/>
Congrats to the two fo you on your 100th plant, we will get back down <br/>
to find it and the rest. <br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Jam n Jelly<br/>

I would highly recommend going for number 6 (Difficult Retrieve) either<br/>

Don &amp; Gwen,<br/>
You're going out on a planting trip for a few MONTHS! It must be good <br/>
to be retired.  Your trip is too bad for me, 'cos I'm pulling some <br/>
strings at work and will possibly be making another visit to <br/>
Kernville sometime in the next couple of months--I know--July and <br/>
August are probably not the most comfortable months to visit <br/>
Kernville, but I say to hell with that; this is my chance for a <br/>
company-sponsored letterbox binge, and I'll gladly brave the heat. <br/>
Gonna be replacing some I.T. equipment at Kernville Hydro #3, hmmm... <br/>
I wonder if there are any letterboxes nearby?? ;-)<br/>
--Buzzard (what the heck am I doing humping over these hot Kernville <br/>
Hills in August. . . aaaaghh??!!)<br/>

  Well somebody has to go forth and seed new letterboxing areas. This trip will be up to the June Lakes loop,and Twin Lakes area(higher and cooler) til about 7/29 then back to Kernville til 8/2. Look for our multi box Enigma series , as this one should even test the most seasoned letterboxer.  Hint---- everything may be opposite, more or less, or not. After 8/2 we are heading back up to Idaho for the Idaho State shoot in Roberts. We hope to catch up with Cadenza and hit all of the new boxes along our route.  If you are in Kernville when we are give us a toot. You should double your h2o supply on hikes and only hit the lower ones in the morning as it has been in the high 90 s , but cooling down at night. Just make sure you hit the HIGH country letterboxes as it will be significantly cooler. I just posted a new one for Gwen's Bday "Boone Meadow" It  puts the "By any Other Name" stamp to shame. Should be back in Kernville 8/25 as I'm putting on a shooting clinic. <br/>
  You know what I would like done with KR 3, read "The Monkey Wrench Gang" by Ed Abbey.<br/>
  We be going off recieving any list.<br/>

I haven't been on the board here in a while, and what do I read?  You<br/>
devil!  A new one?  It looks like I'll be reading plaques in Seal<br/>

I've driven by plenty of times.<br/>

The Pub Crawl is still only one box, but it could be more of a <br/>
challenge as the only non Irish named 'pub' had a fire and I'm not <br/>
sure the name is showing?<br/>
<br/>
The new SEAL BEACH TT box isn't in a particularly cool location, but <br/>
it serves the idea of learning history of this little sin city.<br/>
The stamp was kind of and experiment that didn't work out. I was <br/>
trying to make a stamp wheel, then just ended up with a very long <br/>
narrow stamp. We are in SB and I'll write you off list.<br/>

I got first finder on the box, then I checked my email.  I'll get back<br/>
to you.  Location not too cool, but the stamp was nice, and the<br/>
logbook was very nice.  BTW, at this point is there any kind of<br/>
container you HAVEN'T used to make a letterbox?  You inspire me with<br/>
your Mentos tins, film canisters, pill bottles, tubes with a string up<br/>
a pipe, and a full catalog of Tupperware knock-offs.  :)<br/>

My favorite is peanut butter plastic jars. The one at LB State has <br/>
been in use for about 5 years and still stays water tight if the lid <br/>
is screwed down.<br/>
The bottom line is we are cheap and will use what is available. The <br/>
lastest SBTT box is an exception as we needed a certain size to fit <br/>
the bricks and the stamp.<br/>

As some of you know, Gwen asked me to adopt several of her boxes since she will no longer be in the area as often, having sold her Seal Beach apartment.  Some of them are doing just fine, such as the three at CSULB and the Signal Hill box, the oldest active listing in LA County (the current logbooks inside go back to 2007, but the current stamp has been there since 2003).<br/>

Several others are missing, some of which I simply retired for various reasons (CJs Funbus is gone, for example).  But others I intend to replace, and to that end, I got four planted today:  three of the Town Tour and the Signal Hill Races.<br/>
<br/>
Don and Gwen's boxes were a huge influence on me early in my boxing career:  of the first 26 boxes I found in So Cal, 21 were theirs.  My newest plant in San Bernardino uses the evil "plaque code" I first learned in Seal Beach.<br/>

Several others are missing, some of which I simply retired for various reasons (CJs Funbus is gone, for example).  But others I intend to replace, and to that end, I got four planted today:  three of the Town Tour and the Signal Hill Races.<br/>
<br/>
Don and Gwen's boxes were a huge influence on me early in my boxing career:  of the first 26 boxes I found in So Cal, 21 were theirs.  My newest plant in San Bernardino uses the evil "plaque code" I first learned in Seal Beach.<br/>

Happy boxing,<br/>

&gt; Oh god, that damn plaque - I thought the local transit driver was going to call the cops on me before I finished deciphering that one!!  He must have made the circuit five times and kept eyeing me all the while - fun stuff :-P<br/>

&gt; As some of you know, Gwen asked me to adopt several of her boxes since she will no longer be in the area as often, having sold her Seal Beach apartment.  Some of them are doing just fine, such as the three at CSULB and the Signal Hill box, the oldest active listing in LA County (the current logbooks inside go back to 2007, but the current stamp has been there since 2003).<br/>

I wanted to let you know how much I enjoy reading all the comments posted on <br/>
this group, but especially your comments and information regarding the <br/>
letterboxes planted in So. Cal.  I discovered letterboxing in 2007 after I moved <br/>
from So. Cal. to Texas but I continued to return to So. Cal. to visit friends <br/>
and family.  I introduced several friends in California to letterboxing and <br/>
together we have spent many fun hours finding some of the most beautiful and <br/>
unigue letterboxes that I have seen.  In this post you mentioned some of the <br/>
letterboxes that we have found that were planted by Don and Gwen.  The most <br/>
exciting box that we had found at that time is the "Great Views #2" box.  I <br/>
still laugh about what an adventure it was to find it.  Another wonderful series <br/>
by Don and Gwen that I've found is the CSULB.  This series took 2 days to <br/>
complete because there was too much activity in the area near box #2.  You've <br/>
brought some wonderful memories for me.  Thank you.  I look forward to returning <br/>
to So.Cal. for another visit and to find more wonderful letterboxes planted by <br/>
you and all the other great boxers.  Mothers Love.<br/>
<br/>
