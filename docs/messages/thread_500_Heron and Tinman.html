                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everybody! After taking about a year off from letterboxing, I <br>
rejoined the sport by visiting the Prayer Rock box in Vermont, a nice <br>
collection of boxes in New York City and Connecticut, and the Heron <br>
and Tinman box in Long Beach. <br>
<br>
I didn't think there would be a lot of visitors to the Heron and <br>
Tinman since you need a boat to access this box, but I was surprised <br>
by how few people had logged in in the five years this box has been <br>
there. My boyfriend and I rented a kayak, paddled until our arms were <br>
sore, got soaked from head to toe (letterboxing gear stayed dry in a <br>
special bag that came with the kayak) and generally had a blast. The <br>
only thing I wish we had brought was my dog - we didn't know she would <br>
be allowed, but we will return later in the summer to do it again with <br>
her.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I highly recommend this letterbox. And just thought I'd say <br>
hey :)  -Q<br>

I'm glad to hear the box is alive and well.  My wife and I decided<br>
months ago that we would be hitting this one around July, and it's<br>
sequal "I'm a Heron Too"  Those two are the only local (LA and Orange<br>
county) Don & Gwen boxes I haven't found.<br>

someone prone to seasickness would have any trouble, or is the water <br>
where you have to go pretty still?  I'm hoping to go after it in July <br>
as well and wondering if I ought to take some Dramamine beforehand....<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I got out and found the box this past weekend, so I can answer my <br>
own question: no chance of seasickness here. ;) It was certainly a fun <br>
time (and a good workout!)  My sister and I shared a kayak and her <br>
boyfriend had one to himself.  He coasted along pretty quickly and kept <br>
having to stop and wait for us to catch up, but we enjoyed it, slow and <br>
steady as we were. ;)  Like Q, I definitely recommend it-- it was a <br>
challenge without being too physically difficult and a neat place; <br>
there were tons of kite surfers nearby and I'd love to go back some <br>
time to visit the area with the jellyfish that you can touch (they <br>
don't sting).  I had the directions to "I'm a Heron Two" along with me <br>
as well, but we were pretty worn out just going after the one box and <br>
it seemed a bit challenging to try to figure out where it was from the <br>
water rather than with the more detailed by land directions.<br>
<br>
A couple of little tips for anyone who's as clueless as myself: First, <br>
wear open-toed shoes.  It's that or barefoot only allowed on the kayaks <br>
and you will want something protecting your feet when you retrieve the <br>
box.  This is probably obvious, but I was in letterboxing mode, which <br>
meant tennis shoes, so I had to borrow my sister's sandals when we got <br>
there.  Also, the place we rented the kayaks from was quite reasonable <br>
(in our opinions anyway), but it was just a little stand on the beach, <br>
so it was cash only, so once again I was unprepared.  My sister's <br>
boyfriend payed, but I made up for it by treating them both to a late <br>
lunch/early dinner at Ruby's. :)<br>
