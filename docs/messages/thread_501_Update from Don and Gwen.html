Hi Q<br>
We just picked up our email here at the KOA in Coeur d'Alene. Thanks <br>
for the update on this box. I guess you might have been 2nd finder as <br>
we have had only one other finder report on this box and that was <br>
Katpaw a few months after we planted it. We met Funhog around her turf <br>
at Crooked River Ranch, and met the Pepes, and Lazy Letterboxer, both <br>
couples from Ct. The hog hiked our buns off and we found some <br>
Legerdermaine beauties also. It is always neat to be able to meet some <br>
folks that you communicate with  over the internet. Had a great little <br>
gathering at Funhogs rancho and met the 4 D Toes and Birder. If you <br>
would please post this on SoCal list as a reminder that we are on the <br>
road and only some of our email gets through. Using 'Contact the <br>
Placer' is one method to reach us, but as you now realize it might <br>
take us 5 to 10 days to get the message and maybe just as long to <br>
reply.<br>
Thanks<br>
Don & Gwen<br>
<br>
