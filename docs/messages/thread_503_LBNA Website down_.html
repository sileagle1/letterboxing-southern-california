about all the news there's been so far.  I'm sure it'll be posted on <br>
the main group as soon as a solution is found.  In the mean time, <br>
this certainly makes the case for listing your boxes on both LbNA <br>
*and* AQ.  There are so many boxers in my area who only use LbNA, <br>
unfortunately.<br>

that also means that it's going to cost five times as much as it used <br>

Gwen & I are on our swing back south. Currently at Susanville and <br>
headed into Artrekker's neighborhood for a week.<br>
<br>
Here is a tip for those that have lettereboxing withdrawal you can get <br>
many clues by going to AQ click on a clue and even if the host is LbNA <br>
you can click on "CACHED CLUES".<br>
<br>
This will get you to the most recent update.<br>
