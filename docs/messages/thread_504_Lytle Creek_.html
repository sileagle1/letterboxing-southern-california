If you search LBNA, you will find a few of my boxes close by.  From <br/>
the Devore area where the I-15 and I-215 meet you could go after:<br/>
<br/>
Out of the Park ( 1 box) - 3.5 miles south along I-215 - driveby,<br/>
<br/>
Lost Lake (2 boxes) - 5 miles north - short hike of geologic interest,<br/>
<br/>
Pacific Crest Trail (4 boxes) - 7 miles north - moderate hike,<br/>
<br/>
Cajon Summit (2 boxes) - 12 miles north - short hike<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not many people have hit these, they should all be in place.<br/>
