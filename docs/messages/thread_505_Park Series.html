wanted to let you know I've finally replaced "The Pirate's Booty"<br/>
after many months.  I was concerned the original would come up<br/>
missing, since the park had no good hiding places, and sure enough it<br/>
did within a few weeks of it's initial placement.  After much thought<br/>
and procrastination, I finally put a new letterbox out in a different<br/>
park.  Gone are the semi-clever clues I'd written, but now I'm<br/>
confident the box will be there when you go looking.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I've still got a box missing in my Ocean Blvd Series and<br/>
one missing in my San Pedro Series, so I need to get to work.<br/>
