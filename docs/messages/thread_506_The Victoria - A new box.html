                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello Everybody,<br>
During a recent trip to Texas, I learned that they have a special <br>
bus that travels around Texas collecting stamps of famous Texans. <br>
And while discussing the idea at the BASS gathering, I decided to <br>
launch something similar. So here's the deal:<br>
<br>
In 1542 Juan Rodgriquez Cabrillo sailed two ships to Alta <br>
California. The two ships were the San Salvador and the Victoria. <br>
Unfortunately the San Salvador sank, however, I have aquired the <br>
Victoria and have rebuilt her. <br>
<br>
She will set sail around California gathering stamps of famous or <br>
significant Californian's and stamps of items of California <br>
significant cargo. The Victoria is large, and will accomodate many <br>
passengers and lots of cargo. The voyages will be only 7 - 10 days <br>
therefore passengers and cargo should be ready to board prior to the <br>
captain setting sail. <br>
<br>
The voyages of the Victoria will only be posted on the Letterboxing <br>
Northern California and the Letterboxing Southern California groups. <br>
Please do not post anything about the Victoria anyplace other than <br>
these two spots. <br>
<br>
Once the Victoria has docked another captain may find her, add one <br>
person and/or one item of cargo and set sail for another port. <br>
<br>
I'm not one for many "rules" but I feel compelled to make some up <br>
just to make the game fair for everybody and to expain how this is <br>
supposed to work. So here they are:<br>
<br>
The Rules of the Victoria<br>
<br>
1. The person who picks up the Victoria becomes the Captain. The <br>
Captain may have co-captains<br>
<br>
2. The Captain may allow one person of significance to California to <br>
board and or one item of cargo to be loaded onto the Victoria. <br>
Famous Californians also welcome to board. It item of cargo must <br>
also have some significance to California<br>
<br>
3. The Victoria voyages are a maximum of 7 to 10 days from port to <br>
port. The shorter the voyage time the better.<br>
<br>
4. The voyages of the Victoria must be at least 40 miles from port <br>
to port. The longer the voyage the better.  <br>
<br>
5. The Victoria can only be sailed within the State of California. <br>
Out of State Captains are welcome to sail the Victoria, but the <br>
Victoria must sail only in California.<br>
<br>
6. The Captain may sail the Victoria more than one voyage but not <br>
consecutive voyages. <br>
<br>
7. The Captain will notify other potential captains of the new port <br>
only on the Letterboxing Northern California and Letterboxing <br>
Southern California Yahoo Groups. Both groups must be notified <br>
simultaneously.   No advanced notice to anybody. <br>
<br>
8. The Captain will notify when the Victoria has set sail by posting <br>
on the Letterboxing Northern California and Letterboxing Southern <br>
California Yahoo Groups.<br>
<br>
9. The Captain will hide the Victoria very carefully due to the size <br>
to ensure the ship's safety.<br>
<br>
10. Ports can be anyplace within California. (Not only Oceanside)<br>
<br>
<br>
So that's it... The Victoria will set sail on it's maiden voyage <br>
since being rebuilt someplace in Central California in the next 14 <br>
days. The first passenger to board will be Father Junipero Serra and <br>
the first item of cargo will be the California Golden Poppy. <br>
