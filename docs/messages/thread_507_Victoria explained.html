The Victoria travels by the captain's vehicle from port to port. (no <br/>
mail)<br/>
<br/>
The new port is where ever the captain decides it can be hidden <br/>
well. It can be existing LB spot or a new spot. (it's pretty big)<br/>
<br/>
All the rubber stamps of the passengers and cargo stay in the <br/>
Victoria for future Captains to stamp into their log books. That's <br/>
why the Victoria is large, to hold the  rubber stamps. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, As the captain you will stamp the log book too.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think it is necessary to clear your passenger and cargo with <br/>
me. Maybe when it sets sail the captain can tell the group 1. that <br/>
it has set sail, and 2. Who and what has boarded.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't see the actual Texas Bus, but I saw some of the passenger <br/>
stamps in Puddle Splasher's log book. It was famous Texas such as <br/>
sport stars, historical characters, etc.  It's totally a LB thing, <br/>
<br/>
Hope that clears it up. <br/>

What a cool and innovative new idea Sally! I have a few questions <br/>
for clarification:<br/>
<br/>
Does the Victoria travel by mail carrier, or to designated spots <br/>
such as already established <br/>
LB spots? Or is it a new hiding spot that is established each time? <br/>
Or by the Captain's <br/>
transportation vehicle of choice?<br/>
<br/>
Do all the cumulative stamps stay with the Victoria?<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought that *we* were the significant Californians, but <br/>
now I see that we are the <br/>
Captains - I assume we stamp in somewhere too?<br/>
<br/>
Should we clear with you our choices of Californians and cargo items <br/>
so there aren't <br/>
duplicates?<br/>
<br/>
What kind of stamps does the Texan bus accumulate? Is that a LB <br/>
thing or something <br/>
separate? Just curious on that one.<br/>
