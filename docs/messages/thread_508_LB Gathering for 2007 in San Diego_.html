<br>
I've been out of the game for almost a year because of wedding <br>
planning, getting married, and moving.  But I finally started up <br>
again... Now that I live in San Diego, there's a new batch of LB's <br>
waiting to be found.  Yesterday I found KatieLu's Kumeyaay Indian box, <br>
as well as Don and Gwen's General Andres Pico LB.  Both are in great <br>
condition.  Thank you both for the great hike.<br>
<br>
Being back on the trails again got me thinking... would anyone be <br>
interested in coming to San Diego for a 2007 Southern California LB <br>
Gathering? The one that Q set up in LA two years ago was so much fun, <br>
and it was great getting to meet everyone!! Let me know if you'd be <br>
willing to come down south.  If the response looks good, then I'll <br>
start the planning phases in the next month or so!!<br>
<br>

  How's it going? I'm in for a San Diego LB Gathering. I've been out of the letterboxing loop for a while because of an injury, but I'm on the mend and ready to go (as soon as this infernal hot weather passes).  I've got about four letterboxes that have been carved and ready for planting for at least a year now, but various things have kept me from getting into the field.  I've even got a New Year 2006 stamp that I didn't get to plant; I wonder if can change that carved 2006 into a 2007??  Stamp-carved sixes don't really translate well into sevens.<br>

Congrats on getting married! Seems a few of us have been out of the loop<br>
for a bit, me due to my Step-Dad passing away, moving my Mom and making<br>
sure she would be ok, but, I'm gettin back into the swing of things and<br>
dragged my brother (Groggy Froggy, San Jose) into it too! Ok, it's not<br>
like he was kicking and screaming!<br>
 <br>
Anyway, I think another gathering would be fun and I don't mind cruisin<br>
down. Maybe I can get my brother to take some time off work and come,<br>
too.<br>
 <br>
Thanks for thinking about it, I hope it works out.<br>
