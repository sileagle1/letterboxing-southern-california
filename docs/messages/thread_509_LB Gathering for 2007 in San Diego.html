<br>
I'm totally in for a San Diego gathering!  I too have been a little lax in my letterboxing, but I have several friends who would probably be interested, too.  This will just be more motivation for me to get out there and box - there are a lot of great new boxes out there that I need to pick up.  But I'd also like to meet some local boxers - haven't seen many of you on the trails!<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Cattail  :)<br>
