                    <div class="plaintext-content">For further explanation on "C" count, "C" is for confiscation of letterboxes from our land that the NPS deem inappropriate in "their" rules. There are letterboxes on land controlled by NPS, and if the clues are properly masked ,or are not posted but passed on from letterboxer to letterboxer they survive. If you use the location in the title or text the letterbox will not last long. If you set up the letterbox as a mystery box it will probably last. We have atleast one NPS employee that gets the main chat list, and I believe the chat list is checked on a regular basis. My guess is that this list is NPS free ,but don't bet that it will stay that way. Be cautious in posting anything about letterboxes , or clues that relate to letterboxes on land controlled by NPS on this ,or any other list. I have seen entries on letterbox logs in BLM areas that have a notation by a NPS employee that they were "Noting"the location. Am I paranoid, probably, but I'm planning on not having our "C" count increased,as their rules don't seem to match our rules. Don<br>

Guess where 1/2 the boxes I planted on my last vacation were?   A National Park and a National Monument, both run by the NPS!  Looks like it is time for some creative mystery boxes!<br>
<br>
The thing that surprises me about that is that I know of at least one box in a well visited National Park that has had a lot of visitors that mentions the park as the city, is not masked and is named after a well known landmark in the park and yet is still there over 2 years later.  I guess it is hit or miss as to whether the NPS gets you or not.<br>
<br>
Gnosis,<br>
Were your boxes by any chance, in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area?  I have heard that they are real hard-core sticklers about the 'abandoned property' rules (which is the official reason the NPS is against letterboxes).<br>
