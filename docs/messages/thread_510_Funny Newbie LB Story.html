name at the moment). Anyway, being new we were not prepared with all <br>
the gadgets that letterboxers need to properly find a box. We were <br>
kind of "winging it". So the clues were pretty easy and we got to the <br>
land mark in the clue. Then it said to turn 70% and look for an oak <br>
tree with a moss covered rock at the base. One of the items we didn't <br>
have was a compass. So using my Junior High geometry skills I <br>
estimated 70% and looked around for a tree with a moss covered rock. <br>
Too my excitement, I found one and hidden beneath it, a container. <br>
When I opened it, it contained and assortment of trinkets. Turns out <br>
it was a geocache, not the box I was looking for at all. So, I signed <br>
in the book and told how I found it. Then I did what any loyal <br>
letterboxer does and stamped it! For the sake of the game I also took <br>
a trinket and left one. What did I take? A small compass! Then I went <br>
back to the land mark and found my letterbox!<br>

Excellent work!  You did exactly the right thing.  And now you have a<br>
compass, too :-D  Having stamped the logbook, perhaps later finders<br>
will see it give LB a look-see.  Lots of LBers were (or still are,<br>
like us) geocachers, and many geocachers also letterbox: we do!<br>
<br>
Our first letterbox was found while looking for a geocache :-)  We<br>
didn't have a stamp, of course, but I noted in the log the basic info,<br>
and then looked for the LBNA to report things.  Unfortunately, the<br>
owner of the LB never responded to us, nor to the owner of the<br>
geocache, who moved the cache a little to prevent confusion, despite<br>
that the geocache had been there for a year or so before the LB.  The<br>
LB listing actually was pulled a few months later, which is a shame :-(<br>
<br>
Anyway, congratulations on your (first?) geocache find.  If you<br>
haven't signed up yet, you should, so that you can log your find. <br>
Backdating logs is very easy on the geocaching.com site.  A lot of<br>
geocachers will get a kick out of your story :-)<br>
