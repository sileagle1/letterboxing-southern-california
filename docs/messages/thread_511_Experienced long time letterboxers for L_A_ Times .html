Hello Shana<br>
<br>
I am one of the Moderators for this list. Unfortunately I have been <br>
out of town for most of the summer and had switched off my receiving <br>
mail or notices from this group. My apologies for not answering your <br>
post.<br>
While I'm reluctant to do interviews, here is a way to reach the <br>
owner of the list and another Moderator. On the left hand side of <br>
the SoCal home page click on 'members' then you will find a box that <br>
says search members and you should type in "California Bear" and <br>
that will give you a listing for epolk. He is the owner of this <br>
list. He gets all of the communication on a daily digest so he <br>
should be receiving this tonight.<br>
Another Moderator is "rscarpen" and you can get his information the <br>
same way as listed above. Ryan is his first name and he gets no <br>
email from this group as he moderates several other groups and <br>
sites. <br>
<br>
You may be wondering about my reluctance for such an interview, but <br>
you may get similar reactions from other "Silverbacks". From our <br>
perspective Letterboxing is best spread by word of mouth. Some new <br>
letterboxers come into our game after reading an article and don't <br>
do sufficient research. They forget about being stealthy and sneaky <br>
when they retrieve a letterbox and many planted boxes go missing. <br>
For example when Time magazine wrote a piece we lost 15 of our <br>
letterboxes the very next week. Now that could have been just a <br>
coincidence, but it is my guess that it was not. Sometimes publicity <br>
isn't a good thing.<br>
There have been lengthy and heated discussions on other chatlists <br>
and boards regarding this very topic as many of us see some of the <br>
nuances of letterboxing getting lost in most of the articles being <br>
written.<br>

<br>
I can assure you that the best way to have the vital nuances of <br>
letterboxing make it into an article is to speak to the journalist <br>
on the story. Otherwise, the article will indeed be shallow and <br>
filled with holes. Someone's going to write about it either way so <br>
in my humble opinion it's not a bad idea to explain your concerns <br>
and make them a point of emphasis. Most thorough journalists will <br>
want to write a thorough article. That being said, I totally <br>
understand your concerns because beyond that, our editors have the <br>
final say in what stays or goes, so I hear ya. I will contact the <br>
other fellows you mentioned and cross my fingers. Happy letterboxing.<br>
<br>
And thanks for the input and guidance.<br>
<br>
All the best, Shana<br>

Thanks for your input and I have naturally read the rules, etc. as <br>
well as the seminal article in the Smithsonian. However, YOU the <br>
people who are so passionate about this hobby that you continue to <br>
enjoy it year after year--are my story, not me. The story is for a <br>
newspaper so it is objective, probing. I'm reporting on YOUR scene, <br>
figuring out what makes it special to you L.A. residents personally <br>
and attempting to convey that through your stories, experiences, etc. <br>
from a journalistic angle. In any case, it's not much of a story at <br>
the moment. Just one anonymous source and another person relatively <br>
new to the hobby. With a little luck a veteran will be kind enough to <br>
help me fill in some of the gaps so that the article will do your <br>
fascinating hobby justice.<br>
<br>
All the best, S<br>

Well part of your research might reveal that the first acknowledged US letterbox was planted <br>
in 1998, so there is no such thing as anyone over here who has been doing this for a decade.    <br>
