excuse the following post. Also this post has been cross posted<br/>
purposely as many folks do not read the main chat list.<br/>
Honor Liberty Hitch Hiker was launched 9/11/2002 and it is a Hitch<br/>
Hiker with a different purpose and different method of notification.<br/>
The finder is supposed to post on a chat list the exact location<br/>
where it is left. For background see message # 34174 and message #<br/>
46814 on the main LbNA chatlist. Those messages were listings of<br/>
comments from the letterboxers that found her. It makes pretty good<br/>
reading on this date.<br/>
<br/>
We were sent the text from the logbook from the last finders, The<br/>
Foxes in Montana, and it too makes good reading.<br/>

Never forget the pain and<br/>
Horror of 9/11 and the sacrifices<br/>
Made in the name of Liberty. We<br/>

Many forms and<br/>
All who fight<br/>
Will be honored!<br/>
