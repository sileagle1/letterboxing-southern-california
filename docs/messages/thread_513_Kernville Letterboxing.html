chasing two of Katpau's letterboxes. We found the 'Hole-in-the-Stump' <br>
LB but had no luck with the 'Oak Flat' LB.<br>
For anyone that has been considerating heading to Kernville <br>
letterboxing, and has been waiting for cooler temps now is the time.<br>
The higher altitudes was hovering in the low 50s today while in <br>
Kernville it was in the high 70s. So you can hit the lower boxes <br>
around town in the morning then head to the high country in the mid <br>
day. There are not as many folks in town these days as compared to <br>
spring and summer.<br>
