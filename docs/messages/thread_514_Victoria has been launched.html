I launched her today with Father Serra and the California Golden Poppy <br/>
as passenger and cargo. So she's waiting for the next captain to take <br/>
her to her next port. <br/>
<br/>
Please carve a stamp of a famous/significant Californian and/or an <br/>
item of cargo that is significant to California and add to the ship <br/>
(letterbox). Please see Message 1212 for full details. <br/>
<br/>
Please notify both the N. Calif and S. Calif lists when you pick it up <br/>
and when you drop it off.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Since Cabrillo was sent to California by the Vicroy of New Spain in <br/>
1542, I thought it would be appropriate to launch her on a royal river <br/>
just south of a royal city on one of the two major North/South <br/>
highways. <br/>
<br/>
The exit has a rest stop on the East side of the highway. Go North <br/>
along the frontage road on the West side of the highway toward the RV <br/>
park. On the East side of the frontage road between the End of County <br/>
road sign and the river rock gate post is the Victoria against the <br/>
fence. (closest I could get it to the river without running the risk <br/>
of some non letterboxer finding her)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Sailing<br/>
