It's been more than a year since I've heard anything about my Nike <br>
Missile 96-C Letterbox.  Has anyone found this box recently?<br>
<br>
Also, Buzzard, I'm not sure how to reach you other than this message <br>
board, but did you want to adopt this box since I'm now in San Diego?<br>
<br>
Thanks folks,<br>

Hi GG<br>
<br>
I don't know about your Nike LB, but here is a way to contact Buzzard <br>
off list. If you go to the Members listing and type in Buzzard in the <br>
search box then it will pull up a listing that you can click on and <br>
then you can send him mail off list. Your post should go through as he <br>
gets individual mails from this list.<br>
I see you have been doing some letterboxing as you found our General <br>
Andres Pico. It must have been pretty hot going after that one.<br>

your stamp, as usual, was wonderful!! It was definitely worth it!! =)<br>

Thanks for the tips on contacting people.<br>

We were planning on trying this letterbox once the weather cools down some (we were <br>
thinking maybe in November) -- I know that is a long way off, but if you haven't heard <br>
anything by then, we'll give you a full report!  :)<br>

We visited your Nike Missle 96-C letterbox -- it was there, safe and sound.  There were <br>
about 5 or 6 people who had signed in in 2006, and in fact someone was there just a week <br>
ago.  It was a very interesting place to explore, and a very good hiding spot.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi GG, I'd be happy to adopt your LA 96-C letterbox. I think I was the <br>
1st finder; it's good to hear that it is still in place. At the time, <br>
I thought I lost my original Buzzard stamp on that trek, but a couple <br>
of weeks ago I found it in the back of my car, where it had fallen out <br>
of my pack. <br>
<br>
I believe the way to adopt an LB is for me to copy the post, then you <br>
delete it, then I re-add it under my name.  Of course, you will still <br>
be listed as the original placer.<br>
<br>
I lived in San Diego for a couple of years and would love to attend a <br>
Letterbox Gathering there.  I think Balboa Park would be the perfect <br>
venue.  <br>

This brings up something that I've been wondering about.  Balboa Park <br>
is a national historic landmark, right?  Since NHLs are maintained by <br>
the NPS, are they off limits to letterboxes the same as national parks <br>
are?<br>
