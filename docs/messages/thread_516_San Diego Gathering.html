<br/>
When things get a little closer you might post the info on LbNA like <br/>
you would for a letterbox clue. I've noticed that we have had several <br/>
folks list their name as a 'Found' on our SD letterboxes and they do <br/>
not subscribe to this list. Possibly they would see the listing and <br/>
come to a gathering.<br/>
<br/>
You are probably aware that AQ has a spot for listing gatherings as <br/>
well. Let the SoCal list know if you need any specific help. I <br/>
volunteer for the event stamp unless someone else wants to do it?<br/>

we will keep our ears and eyes open for more info. I really do hope we<br/>
are south when it is on. We thought we would venture out that way this<br/>
fall, but we need to be home with family (Canada) for now.<br/>
When you say early next year do you mean January/February? or March/April?<br/>

OK, here are some details (finally!) for the San Diego gathering.<br/>
<br/>
It is planned for Saturday, 3/24, from 11AM-3PM in San Diego's <br/>
Presidio Park, which is right behind Old Town.  Details on the actual <br/>
location within the park will be announced as we get closer to the <br/>
date.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the activities I plan on having include:<br/>
<br/>
* Lunch - Do you think it would be a fun idea to have a <br/>
little "potluck?" Or should we have bring your own lunch?<br/>
<br/>
* Carving Class and Letterboxing 101 - This will be a little session <br/>
that will be presented by one of our seasoned letterboxers.  This <br/>
class will probably be held after lunch around 1PM.<br/>
<br/>
* Make-Your-Own Memento - There will be a little arts-and-crafts <br/>
souvenier that you will be able to make and take home with you to <br/>
remember the event by.<br/>
<br/>
* Event Series - Aside from the Event Stamp, which Don from Don-and- <br/>
Gwen has so graciously offered  to carve, there will be a LB series <br/>
planted in the park for the event!<br/>
<br/>
* MAKE NEW FRIENDS AND HAVE LOTS OF FUN!!<br/>
<br/>
After the class, the afternoon will be pretty much open for folks to <br/>
do as they choose.  I'm sure there will be lots of letterboxing to do!<br/>
<br/>
Folks, please send me your thoughts and comments to <br/>
geishagirl29127@hotmail.com.  I would really appreciate any feedback <br/>
that you may have.  Also, if possible, please RSVP by 3/16 so I can <br/>
get an idea for how many people will be there.  I will post this on <br/>
AtlasQuest, so if you could RSVP there, I'd really appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting a bunch of you and having a great time!<br/>

Hi Kelsung and others going to San Diego<br/>
<br/>
If you go to Atlas Quest and use the pull down at "toolbox" you can <br/>
click on "EVENTS". Once there scroll down to the listing for San <br/>
Diego, March 24. You can RSVP there.<br/>
<br/>
Don<br/>

&gt; Well, count my wife and I in!  We'll play hooky from our restaurant<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey D&amp;G,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe you can get your son-in-law to carve the event stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Reply:<br/>
<br/>
D&amp;G, <br/>
We all know your son-in-law carves the most beautiful letterboxing <br/>
stamps in the realm.  Your own stamps are second to none (except for, <br/>
of course, your son-in-law's).  By the way, I have a Word-of-Mouth<br/>
(WOM) letterbox that has been hidden for a couple of years in the San <br/>
Gabriel Mountains above my house in Pasadena.  I hid it, but never <br/>
gave anyone the clues.  It's a nice carving, and I have every reason <br/>
to believe it's still lying up there, undisturbed beneath the oaks.  <br/>
The location can be reached by a 6-mile round-trip "moderate" hike in <br/>
the Angeles National Forest.  Please note that this is a "moderate" <br/>
hike, not an "easy" hike.  Hiking time will be at least 3 hours, and <br/>
you will get winded.  It's also wilderness-y, and it's possible <br/>
you'll run into some lions and tigers and bears--I'm serious.  I will <br/>
give the clues to anyone who attended the 2nd California LB Gathering <br/>
at San Luis Obispo on 10/04/03 (those googlers who carved such <br/>
creative stamps, like Sir B., Jugglermouse, and Ash Raven [love the <br/>
coke bottle stamp]); anyone who attended the Kernville Gathering, <br/>
4/24/04; anyone who attended the Old Zoo Gathering on 5/22/05; or <br/>
anyone who attended the little informal SoCal Gathering at the Santa <br/>
Ana Botanical Garden in the rain on 4/17/04.  I know who you are, so <br/>
if you're interested in this clue, identify yourself and Email me at <br/>
disbarro@sbcglobal.net.<br/>

<br/>
We are at almost 75 people for this gathering!!! I am very excited <br/>
about the wonderfully overwhelming response, but I'm afraid I am going <br/>
to have to cap the signups for this event to try to keep this event <br/>
manageable and fun for everyone.  I wish I could keep it open to an <br/>
unlimited amount of signups, but as it is and being my first gathering, <br/>
I'm having difficulty finding a place to accommodate everyone without <br/>
having to pay large amounts of money to stay within park regulations.  <br/>
I will make the deadline this Wednesday, 2/21 for any more signups.  I <br/>
hope everyone understands!!<br/>

Yes.  I can't afford to give a whole lot, but I can help out a <br/>
little, and with as many people as are attending, if everyone chipped <br/>
in a bit, we could probably cover the expenses pretty easily.  No <br/>
need to carry the whole burden on your own when all of us are going <br/>
to be there enjoying the day.<br/>

&gt; &gt; We can either pass a hat for the expenses or just try to divy the <br/>
&gt; costs <br/>
&gt; &gt; up per letterboxer.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes.  I can't afford to give a whole lot, but I can help out a <br/>
&gt; little, and with as many people as are attending, if everyone chipped <br/>
&gt; in a bit, we could probably cover the expenses pretty easily.  No <br/>
&gt; need to carry the whole burden on your own when all of us are going <br/>
&gt; to be there enjoying the day.<br/>

Since we are coming from the Bay Area, we can't contribute much as far <br/>
as advance preparations, but we will be very happy to help pay some of <br/>
the expenses.  <br/>

for sure if we can make it until saturday.  We do Ren Faire, and have our <br/>
first meeting this weekend, then we'll know our schedule for the next few <br/>
weekends...  <br/>
<br/>
I'd totally be willing to chip in, if it would help keep the gathering <br/>
open!!!  The last time I looked into renting a park, it was $250, and with 75 people <br/>
already, that's only $3.33 each!  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was wondering if any of the people going to the San Diego gathering <br/>
would be interested in having dinner after the gathering? We are going <br/>
to be down there the whole weekend, so it might be fun to have some <br/>
extra time set aside for exchanges and what not.<br/>
<br/>
I contacted a Round Table Pizza in San Diego (1221 Garnet Ave, 92109) <br/>
and they have a banquet room which doesn't cost a thing. You just have <br/>
to buy food. I checked into places before I realized the event was <br/>
going to be in Vista, but personally would rather meet back down in San <br/>
Diego since our hotel is there and I think my little guy (and probably <br/>
my big guy) will need a nap before going out on the town.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would like to know if enough people are interested for me to <br/>
set this up. So, what do you say?<br/>

Now for those that missed the carving class you also missed a really <br/>
