hidden jewels this along with the 'Basement' are the places to look. <br>
There are some boxes listed here that are not listed on the new site <br>
and are still viable. Painted Rocks in San Diego area comes to mind <br>
and was found this last year.<br>
This site can be valuable if you are stumped on finding a spot for <br>
your plant. There are many really cool sites that had boxes at one <br>
time, but no longer have letterboxes there now.<br>
