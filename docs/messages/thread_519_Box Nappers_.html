little 'Heads up' for those that have some boxes planted in the <br/>
area. Our Seal Beach Town Tour has taken some hits. #2 is missing, <br/>
Red Car was missing but has been replaced, Fish in the Reads is <br/>
missing and Anaheim Landing is missing. Just a Number is okay in <br/>
it's concrete lump and Grandsma's Seal of Approval is okay as well.<br/>
<br/>
We had received a report about our Signal Hill Views box, "the stamp <br/>
was missing". I carved a replacement and left it in the box. I <br/>
checked on Signal Hill Races and found the box in place but someone <br/>
had left a store bought stamp and new logbook as some previous <br/>
finder had taken the logbook and stamp.I pulled the box. The note <br/>
inside did say that this was their 2nd letterbox and they found it <br/>
empty, but they never contacted us about it.<br/>
<br/>
I check Catching some Sun in the Quad and 49er Mascot, both okay. <br/>
One was a little damp.<br/>
<br/>
It may have just been a fluke that so many Seal Beach boxes and <br/>
Signal Hill boxes went missing and had stamps stolen but there could <br/>
be a new boxer or new geocacher that either isn't being careful or <br/>
is taking stuff. <br/>
<br/>
The Family Fun Magazine did run an article about 3 weeks ago, and <br/>
there has been a large influx of new letterboxers.<br/>
