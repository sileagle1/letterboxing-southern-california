Have been having a good time and should be in Grant's Pass-Medford in 8 days then Shasta for a couple then back home.  Hope your trip is turning out great.  Thanks for the So cal site.  I think it is very worthwhile.  Regards, Gwen<br/>

  I haven't been to these boxes yet but I must say that great minds think<br/>
  alike!  Last month, my wife and I were there and I was thinking the location<br/>
  for the 'Los Angeles County Arboretum &amp; Botanic Garden Letterbox' would be a<br/>
  great spot to hide a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for giving us the first shot!<br/>
