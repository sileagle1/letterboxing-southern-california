                    <div class="plaintext-content">For my birthday this year I'm planning a day of letterboxing on <br>
Catalina, so I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips (either <br>
letterbox-related or just other stuff to do there) or if I'm missing <br>
any boxes from my list.  I have:<br>
<br>
Island of Romance..., Buena Vista, Pet Ghosts and Wishbone.<br>
<br>
I know there's also Island Fox at Two Harbors, but my impression is <br>
that it probably wouldn't be possible to make it from Avalon to Two <br>
Harbors, do the hike and get back in time for the ferry along with <br>
doing everything else.  My initial thought was to rent a golf cart <br>
while there, but until my birthday actually hits I'm too young for <br>
that and I've noticed they're only hourly rentals anyway and it seems <br>
like you can pretty much walk most anywhere on Avalon besides, so <br>
hopefully all of the boxes are reachable by foot.  <br>
<br>
I'm assuming they won't take us all day, though, so I'm wondering <br>
what else to do with our time.  Of course, this will also depend on <br>
how much I'm willing to spend (and how much birthday money I get).  <br>
The ferry's already going to take a chunk out of my wallet.  We're <br>
already done the glass-bottom boats, so I think I can skip that.  I <br>
know my sister would love to go on one of the horseback rides, so I'm <br>
considering that, despite the prices.  Funny how little these amounts <br>
of money seemed back when it was my parents paying and how big they <br>
seem now, huh?  Any recommended restaurants?  I'm on kind of a <br>
restricted diet right now due to stomach problems, so a place with <br>
good mashed potatoes would be great.<br>

Now if you want to do some research and look for an oldy but mouldy <br>
letterbox that is probably gone you could go back in time on the <br>
main list and look for a plant by Wendy Gault. She planted it around <br>
1999 or 2000? In those days every clue was posted to the main list <br>
and the web masters posted it up on LbNA. (Boy they did all that <br>
work!!!!) I can't recall the name of the box but she didn't have <br>
more than 3 plants. The clue started out "name of the place where <br>
the cubs practiced" or something like it. The plant was in or near <br>
the cemetary and had directions from a specific head stone. Wendy <br>
never confirmed that it was missing. It is not in the basement nor <br>
in old LbNA.<br>
<br>
If you could locate that box it would have a super stamp as she was <br>
a very exceptional carver.<br>

I just found it! Go to old LbNA, then go to Orange Co.<br>
<br>
Click on "Pelican" in Huntington Beach and it will have some other <br>
links on the left hand side. Click on "In Memory of Dorothy".<br>
