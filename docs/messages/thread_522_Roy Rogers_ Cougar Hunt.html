checking on our 6 box drive series. The roads are in great shape and <br>
there is only a little bit of the road degraded near the end when you <br>
get closest to the cave, but 2x2 with good clearance should be no <br>
problem. Deep Creek cave looks like it is still accessable as someone <br>
has sawed off the two rebar that blocked the top part of the entrance. <br>
Neither Gwen nor I went in this time due to size requirements (can't <br>
squeeze into tight spots any longer), but the area was very pretty <br>
with the fall colors changing in the high country. Deer season is over <br>
and these roads will be closed by FS sometime around 12/1, so now is <br>
the time for the drive.<br>
