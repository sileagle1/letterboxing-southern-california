<br>
While you will find that this list is not as chatty as some others it <br>
is your list, so don't be bashful.<br>
<br>
There are some interesting links on the left hand side of the home <br>
page and if you think that you can solve all of the plaque codes <br>
before you leave the computer, good luck. There are some that can be <br>
solved before you go but not all of them.<br>
<br>
Other chatlists have similar links as well as files that can be <br>
perused.<br>

Hmmm - I think I must be missing something.  Do you mean the links in the upper left <br>
(Home, Messages, Files, etc.)?  I only have access to the Subscription Request and Welcome <br>
letter, and one photo album with a picture of Winnie the Pooh.  "Plaque codes" -- what is <br>
this?  One of the attractions of letterboxing to me was the puzzle clues, so solving a code <br>
sounds like fun!  Now, just what is the link that I should be looking for?<br>

Yep, and you should click on "Links" just above "members", then <br>
click on California State Landmarks and then scroll down to Ca. <br>
Landmarks by county.<br>
<br>
These can help you (on some) figure out plaque codes before you <br>
leave home.<br>
<br>
Our Seal Beach Town Tour can not be done on your duff, but some <br>
other Town Tours with plaque codes can be figured out before you hit <br>
the trails. A good example is the Coyote Holes Robbery. If you check <br>
the clues then find the plaque on line you can actually get the <br>
clues solved at home (for one box). This is nice as sometimes the <br>
temps at the plaque location can exceed 110.<br>
