                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, the Catalina trip was a bit of a bust as far as letterboxing <br>
goes.  I went there with five sets of clues and of those was only <br>
able to find one (The Island of Romance...).  This is not because <br>
the others weren't there to find-- I don't know if they were or <br>
not.  But we discovered when we arrived that the road that you need <br>
to take to get to three of the boxes has been declared dangerous by <br>
the county due to rockslides, so it was not accessible to hikers, <br>
bikes or golf carts, so there was basically no way for us to even <br>
get close to those letterboxes.  That left one more, for which we <br>
had trouble deciphering the clue.  It seemed to be written pretty <br>
straightforwardly, but it had us looking for a road by a name that <br>
no road on the island seemed to have.  By that point we were tired <br>
enough and disappointed enough that we decided to just let that one <br>
go.  Someday when the road is re-opened, we'll have to go back and <br>
find those three and figure out the one.<br>
<br>
On the bright side, I did plant one letterbox of my own called <br>
Birthday Bison.  I'll be adding it to LBNA and AQ soon.  And despite <br>
our letterboxing disappointments, we still had a lot of fun on the <br>
island.  We went on an hour-plus horseback ride, walked up to the <br>
Wrigley Memorial and back (that really wore us out), walked around <br>
town and looked at shops and enjoyed some good food.  Oh, and we <br>
didn't know until we got there, but the triathlon was yesterday, so <br>
it was a bit crowded in town, but it was neat to see a bit of the <br>
race in the morning.<br>
