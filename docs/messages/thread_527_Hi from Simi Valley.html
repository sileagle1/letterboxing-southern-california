Just a quick post to intro me and my little clan. We are Katherine &amp; <br/>
Steve and 3 kids, Chris, 8, Brenna, 4 and Trevor 2. We just recently <br/>
discovered the joys of letterboxing and are now seeking local easy to <br/>
moderate hikes for our family to enjoy while we 'treasure hunt'. We <br/>
live in Simi and have many options of a quick day trip from here which <br/>
is great! <br/>
<br/>
Thats it for now... have to head off to work. =) We look forward to <br/>
chatting with everyone.<br/>

<br/>
I was just up in Simi Valley a couple of weeks ago and even had a box <br/>
all ready to plant, but didn't find an opportunity, so I'll be heading <br/>
up there again someday when I get a chance.  Since I don't live nearby, <br/>
I can't really offer any recommendations, though I do know that the <br/>
first letterbox ever planted in California, Circle X Ranch, is not far <br/>
from you, so you might want to check that one out sometime.  I know <br/>
it's up there on my to-find list!<br/>
