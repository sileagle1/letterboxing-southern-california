It doesn't come with the most important blade, the #1, and the wooden <br>
handle is pretty chincy.  I bought my stuff just before Michael's <br>
stopped carrying it, and I really don't know if there's anywhere else <br>
to get them other than online.  Actually, I take that back-- I <br>
believe Tall Mouse still carries the Speedball set that comes with <br>
the plastic handle and blades 1 through 6, but this is an Orange <br>
County chain, so it's probably a bit out of your way.  One other <br>
thing you might check is a local university.  I've heard people have <br>
been able to find carving supplies in the art supplies sections of <br>
university bookstores.<br>

We lived in Riverside for two decades, although we've been living in<br>
Ventura County for 13 years, so thing have likely changed a lot since<br>
we moved.  But there used to be a large stationary store in the south<br>
end of the downtown Mile Square area, a little west of the 91 freeway,<br>
on 14th Street.  I can't remember the name, and there is a good chance<br>
that it went out of business if a Staples or Office Depot went in<br>
nearby, but it can't hurt to give a look if you ever go out that way.<br>
 There was also a large store in San Bernardino, near the mall, but<br>
that's even chancier, I would imagine.<br>
<br>
FWIW, any college or university (including community/city colleges)<br>
which has an art department will carry carving supplies in the<br>
bookstore.  All public colleges (Cal State, UC and the CC system) are<br>
open to the public for things such as using the libraries (not for<br>
checking out books, however) as well as buying stuff in their<br>
bookstores.  I don't know which CC is closest to you (Citrus? that<br>
seems a bit far), but you probably do :-)  The best time for checking<br>
out the bookstores is mid-afternoon, when the class level is lower and<br>
there are more parking spaces open.  Just don't expect any bargains<br>
:-o  Good luck!<br>
