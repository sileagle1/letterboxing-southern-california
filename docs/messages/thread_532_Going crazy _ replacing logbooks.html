                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, Tdyans, if your goal was to driving me insane it is working!  I <br/>
have been staring at your Get LOST clue for a couple of weeks and have <br/>
been searching cryptology websites to no avail.  Don't suppose you want <br/>
to give a poor girl a hint?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have another question for everyone out there.  Yesterday I <br/>
went to the 99 cent store (didn't find any lock n/&amp; locks, but some <br/>
other things) and I made myself a first aid kit to take with me when <br/>
boxing.  I have found damaged boxes and full logbooks and wanted to be <br/>
able do something.  So, if I find a full logbook and replace it, what <br/>
should I do?  Leave both logbooks and contact the owner?  Or take the <br/>
full logbook, contact the owner and mail it to them?  Also, just in <br/>
case anyone is interested, the little logbooks I got are miniature <br/>
(3"x3") scrapbooks... only 13 pages, but really good paper.  I figure <br/>
they are good for replacements until someone can get to their box and <br/>
do something themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your ideas,<br/>

I'm delighted to hear both that you're finding it a challenge and <br/>
that you're still interested in figuring it out anyway.  The only <br/>
hint I will give is that the directions to the box are shorter than <br/>
you may think.  Other than that, all I can say is that Dr. Waxler has <br/>
already given you the key....<br/>
<br/>
As for replacing logbooks, I think it would be best, if it will all <br/>
fit, to add the new book but leave the old one, then contact the <br/>
placer.  If there's not a lot of room, you could also just add a few <br/>
index cards-- enough for a few finders after you to stamp in if it <br/>
takes the placer a little while to replace the book.  Most people <br/>
would probably appreciate you pulling a full book and mailing it to <br/>
them, but some might not, so I think the best policy would be to <br/>
always ask before pulling.<br/>
