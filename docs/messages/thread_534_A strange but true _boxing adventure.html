with people who would understand!<br/>
<br/>
This past Sunday I set out to check the  status of boxes in the City Heroes <br/>
series and add a new box to the group. I had  received missing reports for 2 of <br/>
the boxes and had already recarved these boxes  as well. When we arrived, I <br/>
looked first for the series stamp, but it was gone.  In the meantime, my hiking <br/>
buddy found a geocache just sitting out, amongst some  rocks in a cameo <br/>
container. Being the good boxers we are, we stamped one of the  trinkets so at <br/>
least we could have a "find" for the day. That being done, I  tried one more time <br/>
to find my box I had cameo taped and so carefully hid. I  look down in teh <br/>
bushes and see a plastic container! Not the cameo box I had  last hidden, but the <br/>
original stamp that had gone missing 4 months  ago...<br/>
<br/>
We continue on. The next 2 boxes...missing. But not the two I had  been <br/>
receiving reports on. Recent fires and trail work may have had something to  do <br/>
with it as they were planted near trees.<br/>
<br/>
Then, to the next box which I  had received many missing, poison oak, etc. <br/>
reports about. Not a trace of poison  oak or even stalks. And there it was! Just <br/>
sitting under its rock, completely  undisturbed.<br/>
<br/>
Next box was great, replaced the one after that (knew that  one was missing. <br/>
It was confirmed falling down a hole). Then, the last box was  in a very <br/>
burned out area. No trees or shrubs left. I thought for sure this  would be gone <br/>
when I saw the area....but no! The box had a bit of melted edges  but there it <br/>
was, just sitting and waiting to be found again!<br/>
<br/>
All said,  the city heroes series has plenty of boxes that are in good shape <br/>
now and the  other 2 shall be replaced soon!<br/>
