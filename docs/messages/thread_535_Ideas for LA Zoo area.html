<br/>
Last weekend the Sonoran and I did Q's Idiot Box Series (got 3 of the six boxes, but that's <br/>
becxause our companion gave out) and Buzzard's Old Zoo Gathering Series "Amir's Garden <br/>
1 &amp; 2".  Combined these two hunts make a good long hike, starting at Q's picking up <br/>
Buzzard's and returning via Q's.  We only found Amir's Garden #2, but I'd vote for it as one <br/>
of the best boxes in L.A. (carving and location).  And Q's boxes never disappoint.<br/>

I definately second the idea of going for Amir's Garden #2!  Be warned -- the hike up is <br/>
short, but pretty steep.  So if your one-mile limit is for time, no problem.  But if it is for <br/>
mobility or "in-shape" issues, be warned!  (It is still worth it!  Just take it slow....)<br/>
<br/>
Also, check out LbNA -- I was looking up some boxes a few weeks ago that were near the <br/>
Old Zoo Park, and there was one called the Lost Texan that looked interesting.  It might be <br/>
more of a drive-by -- I don't know for sure because we ended up going after different <br/>
boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, Q's Batcave series (of which one, I think, is missing?) is somewhere in Griffith Park. <br/>
But I don't know how close that is to the Zoo.<br/>
<br/>
(Speaking of the Zoo, I have been toying with the idea of hiding a condor stamp in the zoo, <br/>
somewhere near the usually deserted Condor display.  But then again, hiding it on Zoo <br/>
property might be a very, very, very bad idea.  Anyone with more planting experience have <br/>
an opinion?)<br/>

Batcave? Did you say Batcave? Oooh... I am sure the<br/>
kids would LOVE that, I will check it out as well as<br/>
the others.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the Zoo goes... I don't see why not, but you<br/>
may need to get permission so that the workers would<br/>
not remove the box cause I know they have people who<br/>
work in the shrubs and stuff. We are Zoo members, so<br/>
maybe I can make it a project to find out who you<br/>
would need to talk too. A zoo series would be good.<br/>
Plus, you would have to pay admission to the zoo or be<br/>
a member so I can't see why they would object,<br/>
especially if the stamps had a conservation slant. <br/>

Thanks, I will definately check out Amir's Garden 2. I<br/>
love the long hikes myself, but we need to get a<br/>
backpacky thing that can hold a 2 year old because he<br/>
cannot handle it. =(  So until then....<br/>

<br/>
Griffith Park - "Winchester" is reported OK, although I have received <br/>
mixed report on "Carousel" (missing, logbook full, etc) I hope to do <br/>
maintenance soon, but would help to know if I need to re-carve the <br/>
stamp or not.  Both of these boxes are easy access.<br/>
<br/>
or <br/>
<br/>
Griffith Park II - "Feed the Children" is a very short hike and one <br/>
of my favorite stamps.  The image is from the artist - Kollwitz.<br/>
"Dog Lover" is a bit of a hike, and all uphill kind of steep.<br/>

also an easy walk.  When we were there, there was no log book for the <br/>
