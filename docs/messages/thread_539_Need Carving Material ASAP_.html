                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I'm officially not good at planning ahead. I wanted to carve <br>
stamps for my boss and co-worker for their Christmas gifts. I finished <br>
my co-workers, but then realized suddenly that I don't have enough <br>
carving material left to make one for my boss! I've ordered some PZKut, <br>
but the company Christmas party is this Friday, so I don't think I'll <br>
get it in time. So....<br>
<br>
a) Does anyone know of a place in or near Orange County that sells <br>
SpeedyStamp or MasterCarve? I used to get MasterCarve at Tall Mouse, <br>
but I checked the one in Irvine yesterday and they had none. I also <br>
just checked the UCI bookstore and had no luck.<br>
<br>
or b) Does anyone in the area have some carving material to spare? I <br>
need probably about a 2x2 inch piece, and I'd be happy to pay for it. <br>
