When we were at Annie Falls and some other spots we kept looking around in likely places that you might have placed some boxes but to no avail. We also left one that we are planning to mask sufficiently. I'm not sure that it would be necessary with the current personnel there, but it would be prudent to do so for probably they will not stay ignorant about letterboxes. I couldn't believe Amanda's letterbox was still there, as I even carved a replacement called "Amanda's NOT" that fortunately wasn't used. You skipped the Crags Letterbox and I do not recollect if you went to Burney Falls or not but if you haven't been there make sure you go on your next trip up !!!!!!!!!  We left a few more along the coast and found a covered bridge between Rosedale and Coos Bay that was crying out for a driveby LB. Don <br/>

  &gt; You skipped the Crags Letterbox and I do not recollect if you went to Burney Falls or not but if you &gt; haven't been there make sure you go on your next trip up !!!!!!!!<br/>

Unfortunately, I didn't enough time to get all the boxes along that stretch of the I-5.  We had talked to Doublesaj and she said that her Tip of Shasta was a quickie and in a spot where there wouldn't be anyone around so we skipped the Crags and got that one for the sake of expediency.<br/>
<br/>
I actually didn't put any more boxes at Crater Lake although I thought the Pinnacles area would be a cool spot.  We took a trail from the Pinnacles parking area and found a big East Entrance sign for Crater Lake NP on the trail.  It was really strange to see this huge stone and wood sign next to a single track trail.  I think there used to be a road that came up there because we saw a section of woods where all the trees were younger than the others.  That section was suspiciously about as wide as a road and ran toward the parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway!  I was going to say that would be a great spot for a box because it is only about 1/2 mile trail and technically, the box could be placed outside the border marker of the Park.<br/>
<br/>
The parks and monuments I placed in were further south than Crater Lake.  I am still trying to figure out how to word the clues to hide their true location.<br/>
