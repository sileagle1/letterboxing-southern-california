(sorry if you get this more than once, it's a multiple post)<br/>
<br/>
We are traveling to Phoenix this Christmas and would love your suggestions<br/>
on not-to-be missed letterboxes.  Here's our expected letterboxing<br/>
locations/route:<br/>
- Ashland<br/>
- Drive-bys on I-5 between Medford and LA area <br/>
- Redding<br/>
-Sacramento<br/>
-Oakland<br/>
-Santa Clarita<br/>
-Palm Springs<br/>
-drive-bys on 1-10<br/>
-Phoenix<br/>
-Tucson<br/>
-Flagstaff/Sedona/Laughlin/Lake Havasu (weather permitting)<br/>
-Santa Barbara<br/>
-drive-bys on 101 from LA to San Jose <br/>
<br/>
We REALLY appreciate your suggestions and/or comments even if it's your own<br/>
boxes.  We each know our own boxes the best, right? Knowing which ones are<br/>
missing is particularly helpful when you're traveling with limited time.   <br/>
Of course we want to see some highlights in these areas - it's not ALL about<br/>
F-count!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Time is of the essence - we leave the 19th.  Sorry . . . things have gotten<br/>
away from me (as you may imagine, getting ready for Christmas AND a<br/>
letterboxing trip like this is overwhelming).  We expect to have internet<br/>
access occasionally along the way so we could get your response even after<br/>
the 19th.<br/>
<br/>
A gracious thank you and a very Merry Christmas to you!<br/>

I don't often get to help out on things like this, and I don't have a<br/>
terribly-large number of suggestions, but one that I *can* make that<br/>
is pretty easy, and not too far off the freeway, is one which my wife<br/>
and I did a just a couple-three weeks ago.  And we left an HH in it,<br/>
too :-)  It's Kanan Dume Tunnel #1, which is about six miles south of<br/>
the 101.  Get off on Kanan Road, and head south.  The parking area is<br/>
on the right, just before Tunnel #1; you'll drive through tunnels #3<br/>
and #2 before that.  It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the box, and<br/>
there are some nice views from along this trail.  Total time off the<br/>
freeway is an hour or less.  And if you want, you can go down Kanan<br/>
Road to Pacific Coast Highway (CA 1), turn right and catch the freeway<br/>
just before Oxnard.  However, you will want to take Las Posas Road or<br/>
Rice Road north, rather than driving through Oxnard!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!  HAve a safe trip :-)<br/>
