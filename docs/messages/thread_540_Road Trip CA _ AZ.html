(sorry if you get this more than once, it's a multiple post)<br>
<br>
We are traveling to Phoenix this Christmas and would love your suggestions<br>
on not-to-be missed letterboxes.  Here's our expected letterboxing<br>
locations/route:<br>
- Ashland<br>
- Drive-bys on I-5 between Medford and LA area <br>
- Redding<br>
-Sacramento<br>
-Oakland<br>
-Santa Clarita<br>
-Palm Springs<br>
-drive-bys on 1-10<br>
-Phoenix<br>
-Tucson<br>
-Flagstaff/Sedona/Laughlin/Lake Havasu (weather permitting)<br>
-Santa Barbara<br>
-drive-bys on 101 from LA to San Jose <br>
<br>
We REALLY appreciate your suggestions and/or comments even if it's your own<br>
boxes.  We each know our own boxes the best, right? Knowing which ones are<br>
missing is particularly helpful when you're traveling with limited time.   <br>
Of course we want to see some highlights in these areas - it's not ALL about<br>
F-count!  :-)<br>
  <br>
Time is of the essence - we leave the 19th.  Sorry . . . things have gotten<br>
away from me (as you may imagine, getting ready for Christmas AND a<br>
letterboxing trip like this is overwhelming).  We expect to have internet<br>
access occasionally along the way so we could get your response even after<br>
the 19th.<br>
<br>
A gracious thank you and a very Merry Christmas to you!<br>
Kurious Jo & Wood-aug<br>

I don't often get to help out on things like this, and I don't have a<br>
terribly-large number of suggestions, but one that I *can* make that<br>
is pretty easy, and not too far off the freeway, is one which my wife<br>
and I did a just a couple-three weeks ago.  And we left an HH in it,<br>
too :-)  It's Kanan Dume Tunnel #1, which is about six miles south of<br>
the 101.  Get off on Kanan Road, and head south.  The parking area is<br>
on the right, just before Tunnel #1; you'll drive through tunnels #3<br>
and #2 before that.  It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the box, and<br>
there are some nice views from along this trail.  Total time off the<br>
freeway is an hour or less.  And if you want, you can go down Kanan<br>
Road to Pacific Coast Highway (CA 1), turn right and catch the freeway<br>
just before Oxnard.  However, you will want to take Las Posas Road or<br>
Rice Road north, rather than driving through Oxnard!<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!  HAve a safe trip :-)<br>
