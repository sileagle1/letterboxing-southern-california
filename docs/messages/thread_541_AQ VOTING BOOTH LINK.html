                    <div class="plaintext-content">There seems to be some confusion regarding the link for the voting <br/>
booth on Atlasquest. The information for the link has **NOT** been <br/>
posted on the front page of AQ so anyone just going to the site won't <br/>
know about it the vote. <br/>
<br/>
The voting booth is located under the link for your own individual <br/>
page on Atlas Quest, provided you are a registered member. Hover your <br/>
cursor over "My Page" and you will see it listed along with your <br/>
logbook, mailbox, profile, etc. It is listed at the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
Please go to the voting booth and make your vote heard. <br/>

Thanks,<br/>
