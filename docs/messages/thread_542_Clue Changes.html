<br>
I thought I would give you guys a little 'Heads up' regarding some <br>
changes to our clue sheets. You might notice a note <br>
regarding "Attempts" . This was done due to the listings at AQ, and <br>
the lack of 'Placer' control over this feature at AQ. There was a vote <br>
at AQ and the Finders won out, so rather than some folks just getting <br>
turned off and not looking for a box whenever here were a few attempt <br>
listing  I thought I would put a little explanation in our clue sheets.<br>
