<br/>
  My family and I have just enjoyed our first day letterboxing - we found 6 out of 8!  Woo hoo!  One of the boxes we have looked for before and suspect it is actually missing (rather than not found due to our naivete).  Is there a protocol or proper way to contact the placer or post that the box may be missing?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for letting us know...<br/>

You can use the 'Contact the Placer' function at LbNA or a similar <br/>
function at AQ. You could also go to the members list on any <br/>
chatlist, type in the letterboxers name or trail name in the search <br/>
function and write them a note. Another method would be to write a <br/>
letterbox report on all of the boxes here (if they are SoCal) and <br/>
you can let all of the planters know about all of the boxes.<br/>
Every planter that I'm aware of likes personal feed back on their <br/>
letterboxes whether they are found, missing or 'can't find'.<br/>
