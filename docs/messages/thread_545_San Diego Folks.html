<br/>
I just received a note from a finder that may have accidently found <br/>
our Mission Trails Letterbox and thought it would be a good idea to <br/>
move it to a new location. Anyone interested in trying to find it with <br/>
the clues they sent and find a better location than where we put it <br/>
and where they put it please contact us off list.<br/>
I am trying to confirm exactly what they did and it's new location.<br/>
