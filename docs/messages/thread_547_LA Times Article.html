<br/>
Remember that lady reporter for the LA Times joining our group looking <br/>
for folks to interview, well the article hit the newspaper last Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Since the article was published there have been a few new folks join <br/>
the newboxers group as well as this one. The article was fairly <br/>
written and ended up using some of the info I advised the reporter on <br/>
why I wouldn't be quoted.<br/>

I agree, she did a nice job of emphasizing the secretive nature of the <br/>
sport.  Thanks for sharing!<br/>

Can't wait ....if an article started this whole thing then hopefully a little blurb can get a couple new obsessive nuts out and about to share their favorite haunts!  It's so awesome to see where people love to be ....and see!!!<br/>
