Last week our Mission Trails Letterbox in San Diego was moved by a non <br/>
boxer that apologized in a note to us. Fortunately the new location <br/>
was sent to us also. I contacted Geishagirl in SD and also posted the <br/>
info here on this list.<br/>
We just received a note from Geishagirl advising that Father Serra<br/>
(stamp image) was back home.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Geishagirl for the recovery!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
