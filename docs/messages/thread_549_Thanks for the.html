                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!<br>
We  want to extend a BIG thank you to those who emailed with your<br>
recommended boxes. It helped immensely when deciding on which boxes to hunt.<br>
Even though our potential finds didn't add up as well as we expected we went<br>
to some very neat places and had a great trip!    Thank you all!<br>
<br>
Here's an update on California boxes.  Hope this helps!<br>
<br>
Northern CA:<br>
- Old Sac Landmark Series - found boxes 2 & 3. Couldn't find the medallion<br>
on the wall but didn't make it down by the museums either.  Very fun boxes!<br>
- U-Neak Pig - another good one - dem Kats R Kool indeed!<br>
Upon leaving we spotted a skunk crossing the walkway toward the museums!  We<br>
used our "skunk stamp" for that.  The stamp is usually reserved for when we<br>
come home skunked - found zero boxes that day.<br>
We ran out of daylight to find the one remaining box of "Four in Old Sac".<br>
- Tip of Shasta<br>
- I-5 Good Buddy<br>
- Alien Invasion - loved it!<br>
- Huckleberry - we found box #4.  We believe we looked in the right places<br>
for box 1 & 2, we aren't sure about 3.  The stamp in box #4 is pretty neat.<br>
- I'm ya huckleberry - this one stumped us but we ran out of time too.<br>
- Nimbus Fish Hatchery - safe and sound.  Lots of fishermen around but we<br>
didn't stick around the hiding place at all.<br>
- On the Road again - found the box but no stamp.  Imagine an anxious<br>
geocacher found it before finding the nearby geocache.<br>
<br>
SO CAL:<br>
- City Heroes - we found 2 boxes out of 7, ugh.  Series stamp, found. Pretty<br>
sure Church & Doc is missing, not sure about firefighters.  Lifeguard, found<br>
box, needs replacement box.  We're not sure about the others, a fire has<br>
been through there at some point.<br>
- Cabazon found 1, appears the other is missing.  Nice big stamp and very<br>
creative hiding!<br>
- Blythe Mini-tour - Alive and doing just fine.  Neat stamp.  - Living<br>
Desert - tricky one to get but alive and well.  Someone put a new log book<br>
in it.<br>
- Palm Spring Mystery - stamp missing from box 1, box 2 is intact.  (wish we<br>
had time to carve a replacement stamps)<br>
- Critters of Ennisbrook - found 3 out of 8, ugh again.  Seems like 3 & 4<br>
are missing; Not sure of box 1 & 6. Due to the sheer qty of clues to go thru<br>
for such a trip, we missed the part about writing the placer first.  Darn!<br>
Loved the park, though!<br>
- Family Poker Night - think we found the spot but nothing there.  Not sure.<br>
- Night and Day - love the stamp<br>
- Bike Path<br>
- Desert Bloom - pretty sure this one is missing.<br>
<br>
Happy New Year!<br>
