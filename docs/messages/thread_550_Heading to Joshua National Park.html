Joshua Tree is an area contolled by NPS and it is illegal to plant <br>
boxes in National Parks. That being said if you go to AQ and type in <br>
Joshua Tree in the advanced search you will come up with one <br>
called "Old Time Theater". Others in the area are the boxes in Palm <br>
$pring$. If you plan your trip through Apple Valley you will be able <br>
to go for Lee and Nancy's boxes.They have some in Redlands as well. <br>
Lee is a gifted carver and their boxes are not frequented in these <br>
areas as much as their other boxes.<br>
Check both AQ and LbNA.<br>
