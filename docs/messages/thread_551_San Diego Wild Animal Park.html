The Grumpy Grinch has the Ferocious Feline 1/4 mile past the entrance <br>
to the park. They list the closest town as Escondido. The box is <br>
listed as unknown and may be missing. <br>
<br>
If you use the AQ trip function you will get a list of boxes a long <br>
the way.<br>

   <br>
  Just wanted to let you know that we found the Kit Carson Park LB not too long ago. It was a bit tricky. Here is what you should do:<br>
   <br>
  1) When looking for the "purple Tyler pipe" you will be all the way into the woodsy part of the trail. <br>
   <br>
  2) the broken heart shaped stump in no longer heart shaped (some more has broken off).<br>
   It is small. If you stand at the stump and look over your right shoulder you will see the " 3 large trees in a row " If you go the 8 paces from the stump you will only see the first of the 3 trees because they are lined up and it blocks the other two. So, from the broken stump - identify the 3 trees THEN go 8 paces. From that spot you can take the 19 paces off the trail toward the trees.<br>
   <br>
  I hope this helps! The sculpture garden is really COOL!<br>
