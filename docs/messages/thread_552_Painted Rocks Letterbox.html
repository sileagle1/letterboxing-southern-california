Hi MaryB<br>
<br>
Hooray! We were hoping someone would adopt this box. The location is <br>
pretty cool and is the stamp is very fitting.<br>
You probably found the letterbox clues on the old LbNA site or the <br>
old Basement.<br>
If you found it on the basement then just post a note on that board. <br>
I would also contact Jay Drew, the owner of the old basement <br>
chatlist and one of the gurus of LbNA. If you have any problems <br>
contacting Jay or want the link to the old basement please let me <br>
know.<br>
Don<br>
