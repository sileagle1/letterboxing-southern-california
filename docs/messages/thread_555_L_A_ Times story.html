                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, I have just got involved with LB'ing due to that article. <br/>
However, I have been involved with the international mailart network <br/>
for 30 years. Mailart is an activity which connects artists around the <br/>
world via the postal system. The internet has now taken the <br/>
communication place of what M/A did, but there is still the draw <br/>
(especially strong with artists) of getting the actual object in your <br/>
mail box, sorta like LB.<br/>
I have been carving my own stamps for 25 years, thanks too to M/A, so <br/>
LBing was a natural for me. I also bike a lot (100-150 miles per <br/>
week), so many of my first attempts have been along my cycling routes <br/>
in Huntington Beach, Seal Beach and Fullerton. It's a nice excuse to <br/>
take a break on my rides and it will encourage me to develope new bike <br/>
routes to get to new LBs in the future.<br/>

 When you get to our Seal Beach Town Tour you can expect it to take <br/>
quite a bit longer than Dogs Mandatory. Plan on most of the day unless <br/>
you just hit a few.<br/>
