&gt; I got an attempted report on Tuffy Saturday and went to check it on <br/>
&gt; Sunday.  Unless it was hidden so well that even I can't find it, it <br/>
&gt; does indeed seem to be missing.  I'm rather sad about this one.  <br/>
I've <br/>
&gt; had missing boxes before, but all fairly new or little-visited <br/>
ones.  <br/>
&gt; This one had gotten a lot of visitors, and now the records of their <br/>
&gt; visits are gone.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will be replacing it soon.<br/>
