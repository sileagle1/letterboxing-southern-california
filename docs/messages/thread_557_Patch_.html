There is no such patch in existance. You have probably perked some <br/>
interest here and might interest several folks on the NorCal list too <br/>
if you wanted to have an all inclusive 'California' patch. There is a <br/>
PNW patch, and T-Shirt but none for us. You want to take this on?<br/>

My vote is for an all inclusive California patch. Just in case the <br/>
numbers ordered from SoCal is not sufficient then that allows to <br/>
sell any balance to NorCal. You could post something on the NorCal <br/>
list and if Mark &amp; Sue are handling the poll then they would have <br/>
input. If folks don't like their input or design then we could set <br/>
up our own. <br/>

All inclusive sound like it would be the most cost effective as far <br/>
