                    <div class="plaintext-content">The only rule right now is that it needs to be in jpg format.  When <br/>
a design is chosen and submitted to the company that makes the <br/>
patches, we may find that a few changes need to be made, but that's <br/>
something to worry about down the road-- for now, submit whatever <br/>
your heart desires.  Obviously, not too huge of a file is good, too--<br/>
 we don't want to bog down the page that Mark and Sue give us (or <br/>
bog down their inbox for that matter).  A high resolution file might <br/>
be nice to have on hand for when we submit the design, but for now <br/>
it just needs to be good enough for everyone to see and get an idea <br/>
of what it looks like to vote on.<br/>
<br/>
I will point out that the company that manufactures the patches lets <br/>
you have up to 7 colors.  After that, you pay an extra 10 cents for <br/>
each extra color.  They also charge more based on how much <br/>
embroidery is involved, so if the patch would be almost entirely <br/>
embroidery (rather than having the background material visible), <br/>
then it would be more expensive.  And the other factor in price will <br/>
be the size, which we can always adjust, unless the design is super <br/>
intricate.  <br/>

It sounds like you already have a patch company in mind.  I just <br/>
wanted to let you know that the company I worked with to obtain the <br/>
Great Lakes regional patches did a good job and the prices seemed very <br/>
reasonable.  Here's a link to their site if you'd like more info <br/>
(there is a "Prices" page on the site that lists a chart that shows <br/>
all the various prices for different sizes and embroidery coverage).<br/>

www.patchesrus.com since that was recommended by Mark &amp; Sue, Funhog <br/>

&gt; difference anyway. If there's anyone who would submit a design if <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; extended the deadline by a week or so, please e-mail me and let me <br/>
&gt; know by the end of tomorrow. If I don't hear from anyone, we'll go <br/>
&gt; ahead and vote on the three designs that we do have.<br/>

&gt; Yes, Letterbox (or Letterboxing or Lb) California (or CA).  Any <br/>
&gt; combination would work.<br/>

&gt; &gt; What has been stopping me from doing up a design is that I don't <br/>
&gt; know what the patch should say. It's for the whole state, right?<br/>
&gt; &gt;   So is it "letterbox California" that should be on the design?<br/>
