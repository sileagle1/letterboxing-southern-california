                    <div class="plaintext-content">The only rule right now is that it needs to be in jpg format.  When <br>
a design is chosen and submitted to the company that makes the <br>
patches, we may find that a few changes need to be made, but that's <br>
something to worry about down the road-- for now, submit whatever <br>
your heart desires.  Obviously, not too huge of a file is good, too--<br>
 we don't want to bog down the page that Mark and Sue give us (or <br>
bog down their inbox for that matter).  A high resolution file might <br>
be nice to have on hand for when we submit the design, but for now <br>
it just needs to be good enough for everyone to see and get an idea <br>
of what it looks like to vote on.<br>
<br>
I will point out that the company that manufactures the patches lets <br>
you have up to 7 colors.  After that, you pay an extra 10 cents for <br>
each extra color.  They also charge more based on how much <br>
embroidery is involved, so if the patch would be almost entirely <br>
embroidery (rather than having the background material visible), <br>
then it would be more expensive.  And the other factor in price will <br>
be the size, which we can always adjust, unless the design is super <br>
intricate.  <br>

It sounds like you already have a patch company in mind.  I just <br>
wanted to let you know that the company I worked with to obtain the <br>
Great Lakes regional patches did a good job and the prices seemed very <br>
reasonable.  Here's a link to their site if you'd like more info <br>
(there is a "Prices" page on the site that lists a chart that shows <br>
all the various prices for different sizes and embroidery coverage).<br>

www.patchesrus.com since that was recommended by Mark & Sue, Funhog <br>
and someone else (can't recall right now).  The two look pretty <br>

them when the time comes and see who I like best.<br>
