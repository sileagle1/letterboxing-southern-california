We decided to try our hand at placing a box.  We would love to have<br/>
your help in previewing the clues and the box before we go national on<br/>

Biking in Lacy Park<br/>
State: California<br/>
County: Los Angeles<br/>
Nearest City: San Marino<br/>
Difficulty: Easy, a flat paved path 7/10 of a mile round trip.<br/>
<br/>
Bring the kids! Bring their bikes! Lacy Park is a great place to learn<br/>
to ride a bike.  Dogs are allowed on a leash.  Non-residents must pay<br/>
a fee on weekends ($3 over 4 years of age).  The Park is open from<br/>
6:30 a.m. to Sunset, Monday through Friday.  Weekends: May - October,<br/>
8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.  November  April, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. <br/>
The Park is wheelchair accessible, although the box is located a short<br/>
way off of the paved walk, on a slight incline with lots of Eucalyptus<br/>
leaves.  The inner loop road is reserved for bikes and the outer loop<br/>
path is reserved for pedestrians.<br/>
<br/>
To Get To Lacy Park:  The Park is located North East of Los Angeles in<br/>
San Marino, halfway between the 210 and 10 freeways.  You will be<br/>
traveling a considerable distance on surface streets.  If you are new<br/>
to driving in Los Angeles, a street map may be helpful if you get<br/>
turned around.<br/>
     From the 10: Exit Del Mar and head North 3.5 miles.  Turn left<br/>
(West) on Huntington Dr. and continue for 1 mile.  Turn right on<br/>
Virginia (a major intersection with a stop light).  Through the stop<br/>
sign at Monterey and the park is 1 block up, on your left.  There is a<br/>
small parking lot at this entrance or parking on the street.<br/>
     From the 210: Exit Sierra Madre and head South 2.3 miles.  If you<br/>
are exiting from the westbound lanes take the second left as indicated<br/>
by the signs.  The first sharp left is San Gabriel.  Turn right (West)<br/>
onto Huntington Dr. continue for 0.6 miles.  Turn right on Virginia (a<br/>
major intersection with a stop light).  Through the stop sign at<br/>
Monterey and the park is 1 block up, on your left.  There is a small<br/>
parking lot at this entrance or parking on the street.<br/>
<br/>
The Clues:  The entrance gate to the park is on the north west side of<br/>
the parking lot.  Walk through the gate and turn right on the first<br/>
small paved path (at compass bearing 320 magnetic).  A small sign<br/>
reads:  "Outside Loop Walkers and Joggers Only".  The outside<br/>
loop is 7/10 of a mile long. <br/>
<br/>
At the T turn right (B 20), staying on the paved path, pass a bench on<br/>
your right, pass the stairs and the North entrance gate, pass another<br/>
bench and pass a 2nd set of stairs.<br/>
<br/>
At the Y near the tennis courts turn left (B 180).<br/>
<br/>
At the cross roads turn right (B 260). <br/>
<br/>
At the T, near a South West entrance to the park, turn left (B 140). <br/>
Pass the Rose Garden on the right, at another SW entrance to the park.<br/>
<br/>
At the cross roads go straight (B 160).  Start counting 70 one yard,<br/>
single step paces from the center of the intersection.  You will know<br/>
you are almost there when you see an orange painted spigot on the<br/>
right (six more paces to go).  Turn right (B 160) and you will see a<br/>
tall Eucalyptus tree.  4 paces from the edge of the pavement and it<br/>
will be beside you.  Turn right (B 225) and you will see a twisted<br/>
tree trunk growing along the ground.  4 paces will bring you to the<br/>
tree.  Look underneath the trunk in the leaves, dirt and under a rock<br/>
to find the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
To get back to the parking lot continue along the paved path, past the<br/>
playground on your left.  Turn right at the road and you're there.<br/>

I found your San Marino letterbox this morning, and am the 1st <br/>
Stamp!!  I thought your clues were great, as well as your stamp <br/>
carving.  This is a terrific hiding place; this box will never be <br/>
discovered in 5 years!  Ooops, Jinx, poo...poo...poo!  This is <br/>
probably a "guy thing" but I would have mentioned that there is a <br/>
small World War II memorial in the park that honors (among others) <br/>
native son General George S. Patton, who I didn't previously know was <br/>
born and raised in San Marino.  Thanks for planting the great stamp <br/>
and please do plant more in the area, and I'll try my best to <br/>
reciprocate.     <br/>
