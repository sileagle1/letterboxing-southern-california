We decided to try our hand at placing a box.  We would love to have<br>
your help in previewing the clues and the box before we go national on<br>
the LbNA website.  Happy Hunting!<br>

Biking in Lacy Park<br>
State: California<br>
County: Los Angeles<br>
Nearest City: San Marino<br>
Difficulty: Easy, a flat paved path 7/10 of a mile round trip.<br>
<br>
Bring the kids! Bring their bikes! Lacy Park is a great place to learn<br>
to ride a bike.  Dogs are allowed on a leash.  Non-residents must pay<br>
a fee on weekends ($3 over 4 years of age).  The Park is open from<br>
6:30 a.m. to Sunset, Monday through Friday.  Weekends: May - October,<br>
8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.  November  April, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. <br>
The Park is wheelchair accessible, although the box is located a short<br>
way off of the paved walk, on a slight incline with lots of Eucalyptus<br>
leaves.  The inner loop road is reserved for bikes and the outer loop<br>
path is reserved for pedestrians.<br>
<br>
To Get To Lacy Park:  The Park is located North East of Los Angeles in<br>
San Marino, halfway between the 210 and 10 freeways.  You will be<br>
traveling a considerable distance on surface streets.  If you are new<br>
to driving in Los Angeles, a street map may be helpful if you get<br>
turned around.<br>
     From the 10: Exit Del Mar and head North 3.5 miles.  Turn left<br>
(West) on Huntington Dr. and continue for 1 mile.  Turn right on<br>
Virginia (a major intersection with a stop light).  Through the stop<br>
sign at Monterey and the park is 1 block up, on your left.  There is a<br>
small parking lot at this entrance or parking on the street.<br>
     From the 210: Exit Sierra Madre and head South 2.3 miles.  If you<br>
are exiting from the westbound lanes take the second left as indicated<br>
by the signs.  The first sharp left is San Gabriel.  Turn right (West)<br>
onto Huntington Dr. continue for 0.6 miles.  Turn right on Virginia (a<br>
major intersection with a stop light).  Through the stop sign at<br>
Monterey and the park is 1 block up, on your left.  There is a small<br>
parking lot at this entrance or parking on the street.<br>
<br>
The Clues:  The entrance gate to the park is on the north west side of<br>
the parking lot.  Walk through the gate and turn right on the first<br>
small paved path (at compass bearing 320 magnetic).  A small sign<br>
reads:  "Outside Loop Walkers and Joggers Only".  The outside<br>
loop is 7/10 of a mile long. <br>
<br>
At the T turn right (B 20), staying on the paved path, pass a bench on<br>
your right, pass the stairs and the North entrance gate, pass another<br>
bench and pass a 2nd set of stairs.<br>
<br>
At the Y near the tennis courts turn left (B 180).<br>
<br>
At the cross roads turn right (B 260). <br>
<br>
At the T, near a South West entrance to the park, turn left (B 140). <br>
Pass the Rose Garden on the right, at another SW entrance to the park.<br>
<br>
At the cross roads go straight (B 160).  Start counting 70 one yard,<br>
single step paces from the center of the intersection.  You will know<br>
you are almost there when you see an orange painted spigot on the<br>
right (six more paces to go).  Turn right (B 160) and you will see a<br>
tall Eucalyptus tree.  4 paces from the edge of the pavement and it<br>
will be beside you.  Turn right (B 225) and you will see a twisted<br>
tree trunk growing along the ground.  4 paces will bring you to the<br>
tree.  Look underneath the trunk in the leaves, dirt and under a rock<br>
to find the letterbox.<br>
<br>
To get back to the parking lot continue along the paved path, past the<br>
playground on your left.  Turn right at the road and you're there.<br>

I found your San Marino letterbox this morning, and am the 1st <br>
Stamp!!  I thought your clues were great, as well as your stamp <br>
carving.  This is a terrific hiding place; this box will never be <br>
discovered in 5 years!  Ooops, Jinx, poo...poo...poo!  This is <br>
probably a "guy thing" but I would have mentioned that there is a <br>
small World War II memorial in the park that honors (among others) <br>
native son General George S. Patton, who I didn't previously know was <br>
born and raised in San Marino.  Thanks for planting the great stamp <br>
and please do plant more in the area, and I'll try my best to <br>
reciprocate.     <br>
