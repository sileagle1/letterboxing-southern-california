                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
I am so glad that so many of you have signed up for the event <br>
already!! I don't think we've ever had so many people sign up for a <br>
gathering here in Southern California...This is all very exciting!!<br>
<br>
Since the number of attendees is steadily growing (we're already at <br>
54 people!!), I am going to look for a more suitable place to <br>
accommodate such a large group, and that allows pets (at least on a <br>
leash), and has a playground for the kids nearby. The location will <br>
still be in the City of San Diego. I have a few parks in mind, and <br>
I'm working to find out the details and regulations of the different <br>
parks. Please bear with me as I search for a new location. I should <br>
have an announcement for the new location in a few weeks.<br>
<br>
San Diego locals, if you have any suggestions, please let me know! We <br>
need a place with a lot of grass, at least 3 tables, and if <br>
reservations for a large group is necessary, something that isn't too <br>
pricey to reserve.<br>
<br>
We are less than two months away from the event! Thanks everyone for <br>
your feedback so far and your offers of help. They are very much <br>
appreciated!!!<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
GG<br>
