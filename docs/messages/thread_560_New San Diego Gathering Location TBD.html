<br/>
I am so glad that so many of you have signed up for the event <br/>
already!! I don't think we've ever had so many people sign up for a <br/>
gathering here in Southern California...This is all very exciting!!<br/>
<br/>
Since the number of attendees is steadily growing (we're already at <br/>
54 people!!), I am going to look for a more suitable place to <br/>
accommodate such a large group, and that allows pets (at least on a <br/>
leash), and has a playground for the kids nearby. The location will <br/>
still be in the City of San Diego. I have a few parks in mind, and <br/>
I'm working to find out the details and regulations of the different <br/>
parks. Please bear with me as I search for a new location. I should <br/>
have an announcement for the new location in a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
San Diego locals, if you have any suggestions, please let me know! We <br/>
need a place with a lot of grass, at least 3 tables, and if <br/>
reservations for a large group is necessary, something that isn't too <br/>
pricey to reserve.<br/>
<br/>
We are less than two months away from the event! Thanks everyone for <br/>
your feedback so far and your offers of help. They are very much <br/>
appreciated!!!<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
GG<br/>
