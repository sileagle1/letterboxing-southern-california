your RSVP at Atlas Quest so that Geishagirl has an idea how many might <br/>
be in attendance. The listing can be found in the 'Toolbox' pull down <br/>
and is titled 'Events'. (duh) Just scroll down until you find 3/24/2007 <br/>
(double duh) and click on. (triple duh)<br/>
<br/>
I think she was originally expecting about 20 folks....Hah! So the <br/>
location might have to change to another park. If you are listed then <br/>
you will probably get notification of any changes. <br/>
