You should remember that Letterboxes have an artsy side and with most <br/>
art folks have different tastes.<br/>
 Welcome to the reactions placers sometime receive. Once in a while <br/>
several of us that have a bunch of plants compare 'Contact the Finder' <br/>
notes we have received. There have been some real doozies.<br/>
Here is one we received on a rest stop driveby a few years back.<br/>
<br/>
"Couldn't find your letterbox. You should change the clues. Is <br/>
the 'Interpretive' signs the ones that have information on them?(Duh! <br/>
Don's comment)<br/>
What do Junipers look like? (The only trees around! Don's comment)<br/>
It was cold and rainy out so you should make the walk shorter."<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, maybe we should have left overcoats and umbrellas in the parking <br/>
lot too!<br/>
<br/>
For any negative comments you might receive you will probably get ten <br/>
fold in positive comments.<br/>
<br/>
Funhog had a pretty good one and it went something like this.<br/>
<br/>
"Couldn't find your crummy letterbox. It cost me 5 bucks to park and <br/>
your clues suck."<br/>
At least it was succinct and to the point.<br/>
<br/>
For those that have found or attempted the Hog's letterboxes you always <br/>
have to hike a little further than you think, her clues are rather <br/>
obscure, but the end is always a treat with pretty good stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Keep on a hiding them! We all get some classic notes.<br/>
<br/>

put a note in my clues that this may be the case sometimes.  I have <br/>

them.  Just seems awfully unfriendly to me.  The only time I have <br/>
ever sent comments was to inform the placer that their logbook was <br/>
full (or getting full - as I sent to you, Don &amp; Gwen, I believe - <br/>
last week), or to let them know if something was damaged.<br/>
<br/>
Now, don't think I'm being a cry-baby or anything...I will continue <br/>

much about and that is the rating systems on AQ with Blue Diamonds and <br/>
Placers favorite. We (Gwen and I) have opted out of the system and do <br/>
not set our letterboxes up as favorites or have them marked with BDs. <br/>
We do not rate others letterboxes either. We feel that rating tends to <br/>
detract from the experience, but that is just our personal choice.<br/>
So when registering your finds at AQ on our letterboxes you don't have <br/>
to rate any of our letterboxes as the rating won't show up. <br/>
<br/>
We are not being critical of anyone that chooses to use the system as <br/>
that choice is totally up to the individual placer.<br/>

Well, I'll apologize for them.  Don't let one bad apple discourage<br/>
you.  I've found boxes with poor carvings, terrible locations and<br/>
badly written clues, but every box has provided me some kind of<br/>
enjoyment with the experience.<br/>
<br/>
I look at a bad carving as all the more beautiful because someone with<br/>
no talent still gave it their best effort.  I think a bad location is<br/>
just a challenge to my stealth abilities, and an urban driveby is just<br/>
as good as a 10 mile hike.  As for clue writing, the other boxers I<br/>
hunt with marvel at my determination to find a box when the clues make<br/>
no sense or refer to landmarks that are long gone.<br/>

<br/>
Boy, do I resemble *that* remark!  No talent at carving, that's me :-o<br/>
 You haven't seen a bad carving until you see our personal stamp in a<br/>
log.  And I actually cleaned it up some after buying some tools with<br/>
narrower blades.  Heaven knows how folks will react to our first LB<br/>
when we hide it, as the stamp will probably be a disaster, but I<br/>
refuse to buy a stamp at the store.  Which is kind of funny, as I am a<br/>
rubber stamper of many years, but this is different.  This is one of<br/>
the few "Traditional American Rules" that I want to adhere to.  Some<br/>
of the "rules", such as not responding to e-mails from finders or<br/>
seekers, and having no obligation to maintain a hide (the<br/>
environmentalist in me rebels at the idea of letterbox litter from<br/>
trashed hides), I find idiotic, but the idea of hand-carving every<br/>
stamp appeals to me, despite my complete lack of anything like<br/>
artistic ability in this area.  I'll be the last person to ever<br/>
criticise someone for their stamp.  I might write to ask what it is,<br/>
if I can't figure it out, but I won't call it "bad".<br/>
<br/>
As for jerks, I just try to ignore them, especially as the law won't<br/>
let me shoot them ;-)<br/>
