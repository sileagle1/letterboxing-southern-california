Just to let you all know, I will not identify the designer of the patch so those voting are just looking at the design and not the designer. This avoids a popularity contest and allows all patches to be judged on their artistic merit only.<br>
I will post Monday evening the link so that you may vote. The way the poll service runs is that you may vote once per day.<br>
<br>
Tdyans - you will just have to let me know when the deadline for voting is and I'll put that deadline date on the page as well.<br>
<br>
Once the winner is determined, I'll email Tdyans with the winning jpeg file.<br>
Thanks for allowing us the opportunity to help out!<br>
