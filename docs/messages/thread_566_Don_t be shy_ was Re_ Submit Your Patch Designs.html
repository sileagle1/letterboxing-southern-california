entering patch designs because of the intimidation of having their work <br/>
published on the Pepe's well-known blog, so if those fears do exist, I <br/>
want to allay them.  The voting page will not be available to the <br/>
letterboxing public at large like most of the other pages on the blog.  <br/>
The link to it will only be made known to the members of the California <br/>
Yahoo groups.  This will keep the voting from being swayed by people <br/>
who aren't really interested in the patches, and apparently it might <br/>
also encourage any bashful artists out there as well. ;)  So please, <br/>
submit away!<br/>
<br/>
And if there are any more comments or questions, please don't hesitate <br/>
to ask.<br/>
