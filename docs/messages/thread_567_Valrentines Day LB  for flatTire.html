It wasn't me that took your box. All of the boxes i took and all of <br>
the baggies i took i returned. i appologised for the ones i took and <br>
if you remember i even planted a stamp for april 1. if you don't <br>
remember the clues you can still see them in a place called the <br>
basement .<br>
I have been reely busy planting this new box for Flat Tire and i even <br>
sent in a patches designe to my friend Mark. Have fun this valintines <br>
day.<br>
