<br>
I'll be in the LA area on business over the next month or so.  My <br>
husband will be flying out on a weekend or two so we can do some <br>
hiking & boxing in a better climate than Wisconsin in the winter!<br>
<br>
We're fairly avid hikers, so our favorite boxes are those that <br>
involve longer and/or steeper walks.  We'll only have a limited time <br>
(Friday afternoon, Saturday and Sunday), so can't drive too far.  <br>
We'd rather be out walking than driving anyway!<br>
<br>
We're hoping someone can give us some recommendations and/or tell us <br>
if a few that we have identified are actually doable in FEB/MAR (Mt. <br>
Baldy, for example).  Here's what hubby Martini Man has tentatively <br>
picked out as possibilities:<br>
<br>
Henniger Flats<br>
Las Flores Canyon<br>
WIZ 101 Introduction to Wizardry The Quest for Octarine<br>
The Eye of Christmas<br>
Cooper Canyon<br>
Coyote Walk (Sesnon Trail)<br>

<br>
Indeed!  One assumes that the freeways will be open on a Saturday at<br>
your peril :-o  Sharon was born in SoCal, and I've lived here for a<br>
half-century, and there are still surprises aplenty when dealing with<br>
L.A. traffic :-(  Always allow more time than you think you need, then<br>
add a half-hour.<br>
<br>

<br>
If conditions don't change dramatically over the next few weeks (i.e.<br>
if we don't much more rain than we've had so far this season), Baldy<br>
and most of the other mountains should be snow-free, or maybe lightly<br>
dusted on the north-facing slopes.  Right now, the vast majority of<br>
snow in the San Bernardinos and San Gabriels is man-made on the skiing<br>
slopes, and there is almost none anywhere in the Santa Ynez and Sierra<br>
Pelona.  The Santa Monicas and Santa Anas almost never get any, no<br>
matter *how* cold it gets.  Thus, I would suggest keeping an eye on<br>
weather.com (use ZIP 90001 as your center; that's in the middle of LA)<br>
and if we don't get a major rainstorm through, you should be able to<br>
hike anywhere you want.  Bring some warm stuff for the high altitudes,<br>
but make it easily sheddable.  As for particular boxes to go after,<br>
we're not going to be much help, as we live in Ventura County, and<br>
havne't done any boxing in the San Gabriels, etc., but we lived in<br>
Riverside for two decades, with Baldy and other peaks in view when the<br>
smog wasn't real bad, and have done a lot of "just plain hiking" in<br>
them.  It's worth it even if you don't find any nboxes at all.  With<br>
any luck, you might start to see some wildflowers in the lower<br>
altitudes.  I would imagine that any boxes you go for will be worth<br>
the hike, if only because the scenery will likely be different from<br>
what you are used to.  And you won't need snowshoes to get to them! ;-)<br>
<br>
One suggestion that might help you a lot is to pick up a copy of a<br>
trail book for wherever you happen to decide to go.  Any<br>
reasonably-large bookstore in the L.A. area will have many of them. <br>
"101 Hikes in Southern California", by Jerry Schad, from Wilderness<br>
Press, is a good overview of the whole of SoCal, from the Mexican<br>
border up to our area.  There are many others that are more detailed,<br>
or that focus on particular areas.  Naturally, we have several for the<br>
Santa Monicas, where we do most of our hiking, now.  A good trail<br>
guide could also save you a lot of grief.<br>
<br>
Before you do any hiking in the mountains, go to the nearest U.S.<br>
Forest Service office and enquire about trail conditions and any<br>
passes needed.  Some areas require an Adventure Pass to park. <br>
Day-passes cost five bucks, which is cheap, to my mind, although a lot<br>
of people have expressed outrage (with some validity) about this fee.<br>
 To find a Ranger Station, look in the local phone book, or go on-line<br>
at www.fs.fed.us; use the "State" drop-box to get to California, and<br>
then click on Angeles, Cleveland, San Bernardino or Los Padres,<br>
depending upon which you decide to explore.  There will be a list of<br>
District Offices for each Forest.  This website is one which I<br>
recommend *very strongly* for anyone hiking in any USForest, as it<br>
gets updated pretty quickly for our forests.  Imagine! a government<br>
agency that is reasonably efficient :-) Besides the pass and trail<br>
conditions information, you'll also be able to get detailed maps of<br>
the trails and roads.<br>
<br>
By the way, bring a compass along, even if you don't plan to go after<br>
any boxes that need one.  And if you have a GPSr, the mapping function<br>
on it could save you if you get lost.  Always leave a note at your car<br>
as to where you plan to go, when you left and how long you plan to be<br>
gone.  You might not think that mountains so close to a huge city like<br>
L.A. could be that dangerous, but bears, rattlesnakes and mountain<br>
lions *do* live in them, so be alert.  Make a little noise while<br>
hiking, so that you don't surprise them.  Hope I haven't scared you<br>
off, but "Forewarned is fore-armed, which is half an octopus", or<br>
something like that ;-)  Hope you enjoy your trip!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello Wisconsin Hiker - <br>
<br>
If you are going to be hiking in the Pasadena/Altadena area, you will be right in my neck <br>
of the woods!  (We live just a few blocks from the Eaton Canyon Nature Center.)  If you are <br>
going to go after the Eaton Canyon Hummingbird and Henninger Flats, you should also <br>
pick up California Bear's/Buzzard's Eaton Canyon box while you are at it.  <br>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=2754)  <br>
Be sure to check weather conditions or with the volunteers in the Nature Center if you are <br>
going after the Hummingbird -- if there has been enough rain or snow up in the <br>
mountains, the creek in the canyon will swell up, making it impassable (or just too wet to <br>
deal with on a cool winter/spring day!).  <br>
<br>
I also have a box, Cold Feet, planted in the Verdugo Mountains, just to the E of Burbank. <br>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=28799)<br>
If you can't read the clue, let me know and I'll send a copy to you.  I was super nervous <br>
about planting my first box, and put a F-1 restriction on it, for no great reason.<br>
Anyway, there is whole network of trails in the Verdugo Mountains that make for some <br>
good hiking.  But mine is the only box I am aware of in the area, so it would make more <br>
sense to hit the canyons in Altadena/Pasadena if you want a better letterboxing return on <br>
your hike!  <br>
<br>
If you go after the Echo Mountain series, please do report back on the experience!  I have <br>
had my eyes on that hike for a while, but we have a 5-year-old that hikes with us, and he <br>
is good for about 3 miles (hills or no hills), but then he poops out.  That series seems like <br>
it would just be too much for him.  <br>
<br>
Enjoy your trip!<br>

Unless you have a "Golden Age" pass. Then you would be a registered old <br>
fart and parking is free. Just plop that little card on your dash.<br>
<br>
If you are looking for a bit of Letterboxing history Circle X Ranch in <br>
the Thousand Oaks area is California's first letterbox. The stamp was <br>
replaced with a recarve, but it is the same image Lonewolf originally <br>
planted.<br>

To clarify -- if the creek is swollen, that will only affect access to the Hummingbird.  The <br>
Eaton Canyon box and Henninger Flats will still be accessable.<br>

I'm pretty sure you've stamped into some of my SoCal boxes before, so <br>
welcome back! I know the fate of a few of the boxes you list below, <br>
so here is my intel:<br>
<br>
Henninger Flats: This was one of my first letterbox plants, and I <br>
checked on it periodically for 2 years without a single finder. I <br>
recently found it missing, possibly removed by the Forest Service. <br>
(It was a crappy stamp anyway--one of my first carvings.)<br>
<br>
Las Flores Canyon: The first of this series, the Cobb Estate, is <br>
missing. I don't know the fate of the second LB in the series, but <br>
the hike described in the clues passes over a very eroded section of <br>
trail that scared the heck out of me. I did it once (because I can be <br>
incredibly stubborn) and found the letterbox, but wouldn't ever <br>
consider going back because the trail was too scarey. (But it was a <br>
beautiful canyon, Leslie.)<br>
<br>
Cooper Canyon: This is a strange story. According to the logbook, I <br>
was the first letterboxer to find this box more then a year after it <br>
was planted. But the day after it was planted, a Boy Scout found the <br>
box, thought it was a Geocache, took the stamp, and left a small <br>
flashlight in exchange, which I found.<br>
<br>
Eaton Canyon Hummingbird: This was the 2nd letterbox I ever found, <br>
but the LB didn't last long. I adopted it, and have replaced it <br>
twice. This is a very busy area, so I don't know if my most recent <br>
replacement is still there. (Lovely waterfall though; did you know it <br>
was visited and written about in the 19th Century by John Muir?!)<br>
<br>
Passport to the Falls: I've found this LB to be intact on several <br>
trips to the area. I think it's very possible that it is still there. <br>
The other LB planted in this series entitled "A Bridge Too <br>
Fingerprinted" is missing, though.<br>
<br>
Echo Mountain Series is gone. Pity. Leslie was so right about this <br>
location. This whole mountain is so beautiful and so historical it <br>
needs a slew of letterboxes. This is a future project for me.<br>
<br>
Millard Falls: I have every reason to believe this LB is intact.<br>
<br>
The Elyria Canyon letterboxes were not artfully hidden, and were <br>
placed in very high traffic areas, so I expect they may not still be <br>
in place, but I have no confirmation of this.<br>
<br>
I would like to think that the two Mount Baldy stamps are still in <br>
place, but they were planted years ago. It's a sad commentary on my <br>
letterboxing skills that I have not already confirmed their status, <br>
but I haven't. I'd love to hear if you find them.<br>
