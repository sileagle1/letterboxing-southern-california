<br>
Our page for the new patch contest is ready for your viewing. There <br>
are 7 designs from which you may choose your favorite. <br>
<br>
There is a poll on the right hand side of the page where you may cast <br>
your vote for your favorite patch. You may vote once per day. The <br>
patch with the most votes as of midnight Eastern time next Monday, <br>
February 26 will be declared the winner.<br>
<br>
Here's the link for the webpage: http://socalpatches.blogspot.com/<br>
<br>
It is only published here so only those from the So Cal and No Cal <br>
lists know about this webpage. This will help ensure that those <br>
voting are only from the CA lists.<br>
<br>
Thanks for allowing us to help out!<br>
<br>

I sent a letterbox patch design the first day the contest was<br>
announced. (I have the email to prove it.)<br>
<br>
I'm surprised to see it is not on the website.  Thank you for hosting<br>
this contest, I realize you are doing we Californians a favor, but I am<br>
a little disappointed as I wanted my design to be considered too!<br>

Please try sending your design to Mark again today and he'll get it <br>
added to the page as well and set the voting back to zero.  <br>
<br>
Everyone else: voting will be delayed until later today or tomorrow <br>
probably.  You can still look at the page, of course, but any votes <br>
you cast before this gets corrected will be erased.<br>

Once the voting is over are we going with the patch that receives the <br>
most votes on this first round, or take the two higest votes counts and <br>
have a run off?<br>

think?  It seems to me that if there's a far and away winner at the end <br>
of the week, we should just take that result, but if there are two that <br>
are pretty close in the voting, then maybe a run-off would be a good <br>
idea.  We'll see what happens and what everyone else's feedback is.<br>

And don't forget everyone that you can vote once a day!<br>

Right now it definitely looks like a run-off between the top three is <br>
probably going to be a good idea.<br>

Actually, three finds in 10 days isn't bad.  It took my first series of<br>
letterboxes THREE weeks to get a single finder.  And that was back in<br>
October!  And just this week the brave DemXXMen found all three.  So<br>
two finds in four months.  (One important detail to mention is that the<br>
first box is on top of a mountain and it's about an 8mi roundtrip<br>
hike--hey at least it deters vandals!)<br>
<br>
Don't take it personally.  I think it's also important to remember that<br>
only ONE weekend has passed since you planted.  <br>
<br>
Don't lose hope.  I'm sure your letterbox will continue to get traffic.<br>
 I'm not down that way often, but when I am you can bet I will check it<br>
out.  I've now put it on my watch list for AQ.<br>
<br>
Hang in there!!<br>
