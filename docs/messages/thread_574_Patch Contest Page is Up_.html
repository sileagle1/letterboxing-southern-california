<br/>
Our page for the new patch contest is ready for your viewing. There <br/>
are 7 designs from which you may choose your favorite. <br/>
<br/>
There is a poll on the right hand side of the page where you may cast <br/>
your vote for your favorite patch. You may vote once per day. The <br/>
patch with the most votes as of midnight Eastern time next Monday, <br/>
February 26 will be declared the winner.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the link for the webpage: http://socalpatches.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
It is only published here so only those from the So Cal and No Cal <br/>
lists know about this webpage. This will help ensure that those <br/>
voting are only from the CA lists.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for allowing us to help out!<br/>

I sent a letterbox patch design the first day the contest was<br/>
announced. (I have the email to prove it.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised to see it is not on the website.  Thank you for hosting<br/>

Please try sending your design to Mark again today and he'll get it <br/>
added to the page as well and set the voting back to zero.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone else: voting will be delayed until later today or tomorrow <br/>
probably.  You can still look at the page, of course, but any votes <br/>
you cast before this gets corrected will be erased.<br/>

Actually, three finds in 10 days isn't bad.  It took my first series of<br/>
letterboxes THREE weeks to get a single finder.  And that was back in<br/>
October!  And just this week the brave DemXXMen found all three.  So<br/>
two finds in four months.  (One important detail to mention is that the<br/>
first box is on top of a mountain and it's about an 8mi roundtrip<br/>
hike--hey at least it deters vandals!)<br/>
<br/>
Don't take it personally.  I think it's also important to remember that<br/>
only ONE weekend has passed since you planted.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't lose hope.  I'm sure your letterbox will continue to get traffic.<br/>
 I'm not down that way often, but when I am you can bet I will check it<br/>
out.  I've now put it on my watch list for AQ.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!!<br/>
