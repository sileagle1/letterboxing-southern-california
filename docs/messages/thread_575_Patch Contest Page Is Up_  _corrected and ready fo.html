are 9 designs from which you may choose your favorite.<br/>
<br/>
There is a poll on the left hand side of the page where you may cast<br/>
your vote for your favorite patch. You may vote once per day. The<br/>
patch with the most votes as of midnight Eastern time next Monday,<br/>
February 26 will be declared the winner.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the link for the webpage: http://socalpatches.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
It is only published here so only those from the So Cal and No Cal<br/>
lists know about this webpage. This will help ensure that those<br/>
voting are only from the CA lists.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to Mark for helping us out by setting up the page and poll!<br/>
