I finally got around to actually looking at the designs, and there are<br>
some great ones on that page.  I could go with any of them, although I<br>
definitely have several favorites.  Looking over the voting so far, I<br>
would suggest that any which get less than 10% be dropped, and then we<br>
have a second round.  At this point, five of the designs would be<br>
dropped.  Three of the top four are all very close, and the fourth is<br>
just barely hanging in there, but every contest should have a "dark<br>
horse".  In the second round, if no design wins by a 10% margin, then<br>
we should take the top two and have one final round.  Just my two<br>
cents :-)<br>

I can't figure out what you mean dark house. When i look at the vote <br>
i think the numbers on the right is how they are finishing. so that <br>
means with the best three it is between 6,5, 4 becase they are listed <br>
1,2,3. hooray it looks like i'm going to be in the top 3.<br>

For anyone that has no idea about Geogeorgia, don't get all upset. You <br>
can go back to the main LbNA chatlist circa March, 2005 or check out <br>
her April Fools letterbox in the LbNA Basement. She has a new letterbox <br>
listed on AQ that she is trying to push. Sorry GeoGeorgia, I'm not <br>
trying to spoil your fun, but want to keep this on an even keel so I <br>
won't have to moderate you. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While it is now a moot point, you made an excellent argument for my<br>
position.  The fact that there is even a hint of suspicion of "ballot<br>
stuffing" (not *my* suspicion; I'm not the one who wrote "it does<br>
appear that some folks have been doing a bit of playing with the<br>
poll") speaks for having the 4th-place design be in the second round,<br>
and that we restrict this to one vote per person.  I'm not going to<br>
push the issue, but there is no arguing that my reasoning is valid.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, any of the final three is fine with me.  My own<br>
favorite was not one of these three, but I definitely like the three<br>
finalists.  Good luck to all three :-)<br>
