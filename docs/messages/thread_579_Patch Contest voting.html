&gt; Once the voting is over are we going with the patch that receives the <br/>

&gt; and have a run off?<br/>
<br/>
I finally got around to actually looking at the designs, and there are<br/>
some great ones on that page.  I could go with any of them, although I<br/>
definitely have several favorites.  Looking over the voting so far, I<br/>
would suggest that any which get less than 10% be dropped, and then we<br/>
have a second round.  At this point, five of the designs would be<br/>
dropped.  Three of the top four are all very close, and the fourth is<br/>
just barely hanging in there, but every contest should have a "dark<br/>
horse".  In the second round, if no design wins by a 10% margin, then<br/>
we should take the top two and have one final round.  Just my two<br/>
cents :-)<br/>

I can't figure out what you mean dark house. When i look at the vote <br/>
i think the numbers on the right is how they are finishing. so that <br/>
means with the best three it is between 6,5, 4 becase they are listed <br/>
1,2,3. hooray it looks like i'm going to be in the top 3.<br/>

For anyone that has no idea about Geogeorgia, don't get all upset. You <br/>
can go back to the main LbNA chatlist circa March, 2005 or check out <br/>
her April Fools letterbox in the LbNA Basement. She has a new letterbox <br/>
listed on AQ that she is trying to push. Sorry GeoGeorgia, I'm not <br/>
trying to spoil your fun, but want to keep this on an even keel so I <br/>
won't have to moderate you. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While it is now a moot point, you made an excellent argument for my<br/>
position.  The fact that there is even a hint of suspicion of "ballot<br/>
stuffing" (not *my* suspicion; I'm not the one who wrote "it does<br/>
appear that some folks have been doing a bit of playing with the<br/>
poll") speaks for having the 4th-place design be in the second round,<br/>
and that we restrict this to one vote per person.  I'm not going to<br/>
push the issue, but there is no arguing that my reasoning is valid.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, any of the final three is fine with me.  My own<br/>
favorite was not one of these three, but I definitely like the three<br/>
finalists.  Good luck to all three :-)<br/>

&gt; I'm with Tracy on this. I believe set up the top three and see how it <br/>
&gt; turns out. Having a dark horse 4th pick would only detract from one <br/>
&gt; of the 3 potential winners. Hopefully having a shorter vote period <br/>
&gt; might help as well as it does appear that some folks have been doing <br/>
&gt; a bit of playing with the poll. The top three have garnered 74% of <br/>
&gt; the votes so those that voted for the other 26% can be the deciders.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Personally, in the interest of not drawing this thing out forever, <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'd prefer to leave the "dark house" out of the run-off...<br/>
