                    <div class="plaintext-content">We visited Descanso Gardens today, October 8, 2003.  We were able to<br>
find all four boxes.  I wish I had brought along some plastic bags<br>
though :-)<br>
<br>
#1 The bags need replacing, but the contents are fine.  The log book<br>
will need to be replaced soon.<br>
<br>
#2  We had trouble finding this one, but finally found it on our third<br>
interpretation of the clues.  This one could use new bags too.  The<br>
log  book and stamp were O.K., but the message was damp.<br>
<br>
#3  We would never have stumbled on this trail on our own. It wasn't<br>
even on the map. That's the great thing about Letterboxing! The box<br>
was in good shape.  The bench has been turned 180 degrees to the other<br>
side of the trail.  Probably to keep people from using the extra path<br>
:-)<br>
<br>
#4  This box was a little damp.  The call to exit had been made, so I<br>
didn't have a chance to really check it out.<br>
<br>
What an adventure!<br>
