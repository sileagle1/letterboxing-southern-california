                    <div class="plaintext-content">We recently received 4 comments from some new letterboxers....<br>
Reidling Trinity on a three box series and a single box all located<br>
at Long Beach State college in LB, Ca. These folks have only started<br>
letterboxing since 12/2006 but have figured out the game.<br>
<br>
The notes to us were a small story of their day hunting all 4<br>
letterboxes, including all of the twists and turns they experienced.<br>
One of the series has a note in the clue text, "Only one in five<br>
letterboxers have been able to find #3". This note only spurred them<br>
on and they were the first in a long time to complete all of the<br>
series in one day without asking for a hint.<br>
<br>
While it is really easy to merely post your find and record it at AQ<br>
or LbNA you should remember that the placers of letterboxes like feed<br>
back on their creations. It takes a bit of time to set up a plant, so<br>
taking a few minutes to contact the placer makes the placers time<br>
worth while. Placers don't really expect a bunch of gushy compliments<br>
but really like to know the finders experience.<br>
<br>
Receiving these notes this morning made our day, and also made me<br>
realize how sometimes Gwen and I are derelict in not contacting<br>
placers as we should.<br>
