<br>
I've just updated the Patch Poll page to reflect the top 3 vote <br>
getters for a special runoff vote as was mentioned here. Originally we <br>
were going to wait until midnight tonight but the top 3 were far ahead <br>
of all of the others so we thought it was more important to spend the <br>
time voting for the final winner.<br>
<br>
This vote will continue this week until noon on this Friday, March <br>
2nd, when the winner will be declared.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all who sent in their designs. This group did a great job <br>
in representing all the best that CA boxing has to offer. And thanks <br>
for allowing us to be a part of your patch finding process!<br>
<br>

I think it's a reference to both the plethora of vanity plates here in California (or at least <br>
SoCal), but it also makes me think of the old TV show, LA Law, which had a California licence <br>
plate in its main titles, somewhere.  Sound plausible?<br>
