I've just updated the Patch Poll page to reflect the top 3 vote <br/>
getters for a special runoff vote as was mentioned here. Originally we <br/>
were going to wait until midnight tonight but the top 3 were far ahead <br/>
of all of the others so we thought it was more important to spend the <br/>
time voting for the final winner.<br/>
<br/>
This vote will continue this week until noon on this Friday, March <br/>
2nd, when the winner will be declared.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all who sent in their designs. This group did a great job <br/>
in representing all the best that CA boxing has to offer. And thanks <br/>
for allowing us to be a part of your patch finding process!<br/>

I think it's a reference to both the plethora of vanity plates here in California (or at least <br/>
SoCal), but it also makes me think of the old TV show, LA Law, which had a California licence <br/>
plate in its main titles, somewhere.  Sound plausible?<br/>

Hi WH<br/>
You are not alone. I couldn't figure it out either, but then it took me <br/>
a while to get the Fruits and Nuts one. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi boxers: <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I've just updated the Patch Poll page to reflect the top 3 vote <br/>
&gt; &gt; getters for a special runoff vote as was mentioned here. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Originally we <br/>
&gt; &gt; were going to wait until midnight tonight but the top 3 were far <br/>
&gt; &gt; ahead <br/>
&gt; &gt; of all of the others so we thought it was more important to <br/>
spend <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; time voting for the final winner. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This vote will continue this week until noon on this Friday, <br/>
March <br/>
&gt; &gt; 2nd, when the winner will be declared. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for all who sent in their designs. This group did a great <br/>
&gt; &gt; job <br/>
&gt; &gt; in representing all the best that CA boxing has to offer. And <br/>
&gt; &gt; thanks <br/>
&gt; &gt; for allowing us to be a part of your patch finding process! <br/>
