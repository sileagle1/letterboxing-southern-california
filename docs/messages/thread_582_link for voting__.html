Looking forward to the final vote on the patches!<br/>
I would be proud to sport any of them!!<br/>
<br/>
Who is actually going to have them made up?<br/>
<br/>
I am so disappointed it seems we will not be able to stay in <br/>
California for the event. My mom is having to go in for surgery on <br/>
Mar 20th and I think I should be home as it might be quite risky.<br/>
(her cancer continues to sprread and she was hemhorraging(sp) last <br/>
week.<br/>
We shall have to wait and see...<br/>
We were so looking forward to coming.<br/>
