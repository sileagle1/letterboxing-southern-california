Looking forward to the final vote on the patches!<br>
I would be proud to sport any of them!!<br>
<br>
Who is actually going to have them made up?<br>
<br>
I am so disappointed it seems we will not be able to stay in <br>
California for the event. My mom is having to go in for surgery on <br>
Mar 20th and I think I should be home as it might be quite risky.<br>
(her cancer continues to sprread and she was hemhorraging(sp) last <br>
week.<br>
We shall have to wait and see...<br>
We were so looking forward to coming.<br>
