Anyways, I agree with Mark re: the year 2007 being notated in my <br/>
other LB patches it does not state a year, and putting Eureka on it <br/>
would be a great idea. Hmm, a new letterbox phrse when we find it,<br/>
"eureka!!"<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Mark and Sue for setting it up.<br/>

I think there was some monkey business, but I would be happy with any <br/>
of the three with or without Eureka.<br/>
<br/>
It is after all just a patch and not something to get upset over.<br/>
