<br>
As I mentioned earlier on the SoCal board, I really liked the #7 <br>
entry's idea of using "Eureka!" and I think it fits well with this <br>
patch design, so when it began to look like this one would win, I did <br>
some tweaking with the original image to add that in, and you can see <br>
it here: http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b279/tdscrafts/patch.jpg<br>
If anyone has any objections to using this design instead of the <br>
original, please let me know.<br>
<br>
I would also appreciate it if people would e-mail me with how many <br>
patches they plan on ordering, so that I can get an idea of how many to <br>
order.  I'm not sure of what the pricing will be at this point-- <br>
probably around $2-3 per patch-- but I will work on getting an estimate <br>
soon.<br>
