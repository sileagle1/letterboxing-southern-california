&gt; Thanks for letting us be a part of this journey! Hopefully, we can <br/>
purchase a patch once we letterbox in in your state. (That's what we <br/>
do - only purchase and apply to our backpack those patches in states <br/>

Yep, if you went to view first then it registered that you voted and it <br/>
then wouldn't let you vote.<br/>

Would <br/>
&gt; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have to have a fresh patch made up with each new year in it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just some things to consider from someone who is neutral.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe replace "2007" with "Eureka"????<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mark<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS. I will leave Tdyans to announce the winner at your <br/>
cutoff <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sue &amp; I are leaving for VT so I might not have time to take <br/>
&gt; down <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the poll at the cutoff time. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for letting us be a part of this journey! Hopefully, <br/>
we <br/>
&gt; &gt; can <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; purchase a patch once we letterbox in in your state. (That's <br/>
&gt; what <br/>
&gt; &gt; we <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do - only purchase and apply to our backpack those patches in <br/>
&gt; &gt; states <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we've boxed. Nuts - I know!)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't forget, we have just under 24 hours left to vote in <br/>

arggh! something fishy is going on!<br/>
So, I went on to try to cast my last vote today, I am supposed to have<br/>
until noon to vote and it says I already voted. So, is this happening to<br/>
anyone else?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I have one comment on design #8:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You may want to consider, if this design in fact wins, to put <br/>
something in place of the "2007."<br/>
&gt; Might people think it's only for sale during this year? Would you <br/>
have to have a fresh patch made up with each new year in it?<br/>
