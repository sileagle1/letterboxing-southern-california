There is only one letterbox that we might have a shot at, but it is <br>
well out of town so we will probably just plant one.<br>
<br>
"La Mitad del Mundo"<br>
<br>
 I can hear the clicking of key boards checking google and trying to <br>
figure out where in the heck that might be. Our ultimate destination is <br>
another hop from there but even I don't have the guts to plant one <br>
there. The Green Tortuga is very jealous as he might be right at home <br>
there.<br>
