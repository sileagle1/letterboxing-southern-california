There is only one letterbox that we might have a shot at, but it is <br/>
well out of town so we will probably just plant one.<br/>
<br/>
"La Mitad del Mundo"<br/>
<br/>
 I can hear the clicking of key boards checking google and trying to <br/>
figure out where in the heck that might be. Our ultimate destination is <br/>
another hop from there but even I don't have the guts to plant one <br/>
there. The Green Tortuga is very jealous as he might be right at home <br/>
there.<br/>
