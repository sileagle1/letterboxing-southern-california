<br>
People have been requesting the address of the new location.  I have <br>
updated the address info on AtlasQuest.  I will send detailed <br>
directions later this week to folks registered on AQ.  PLease let me <br>
know if you do not check your AQ account.  I will also be removing the <br>
event listing from the LBNA website so I can keep the most updated info <br>
in one place.<br>
<br>
See you all soon!<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
GG<br>

updates through Atlas Quest.  If you have not registered at AQ, but <br>
have emailed me individually to RSVP when I first posted the event, <br>
please email me and let me know.  I need to know how many people will <br>
be attending the event to make sure I have enough goodies to hand out.<br>
<br>
Thanks for everyone's cooperation.<br>
