hunting.<br>
<br>
We tried to find the Santee Lakes box, but just could not decipher the third<br>
line of the clue well enough. After checking every tree near the playground<br>
and asking a park ranger for his thoughts on the clue, we gave up. We did<br>
get a fish to eat one of our worms while fishing though :)<br>
<br>
Then we headed to Escondido and the Jack Creek Falls box. Don and Gwen, we<br>
are happy to say it is still in great shape and hidden well. And we noticed<br>
no Buzzard stamp, which set my boxing partner, Nik, into a happy fit of<br>
giggles - we've gotten very used to seeing Buzzard's stamp in every box we<br>
find. It was a great spot to visit and we ended up staying at the park until<br>
well after closing - we got kicked out by park rangers eventually :) The<br>
clue page should probably be changed though to reflect the correct closing<br>
time of the park, which is 6:30pm during fall and winter and 7:30pm during<br>
spring and summer.<br>

I got a kick out of seeing my name unexpectantly mentioned in a <br>
letterboxing post, thank you.  You'll be happy to know I've only <br>
found one San Diego County stamp: the Batiquitos Lagoon stamp in <br>
Carlsbad, my hometown. Gnosis certainly have been busy little <br>
letterbox-placing bees, and I am first stamp in your first 10 <br>
letterboxes (I've even got some certificates to prove it).  I showed <br>
up at the Los Angeles County Fair 4-H booth to visit you all, but you <br>
were not at the fair that day.  It sucks about your Peter Straus <br>
Ranch boxes being recalled, but that's part of the game.  You missed <br>
the BEST time at the San Luis Obispo letterbox gathering last weekend <br>
(at least I think you missed it; there were so many letterboxers <br>
there I didn't have a chance to meet half of them).  Thanks for <br>
planting so many boxes, and I hope you haven't been soured on your <br>
efforts by certain governmental agencies.<br>
