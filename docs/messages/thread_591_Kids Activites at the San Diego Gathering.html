<br/>
I am in charge of helping organize kids activities for the San Diego<br/>
gathering, and I have recently been e-mailing people who have RSVP'ed<br/>
for the event and who signed up as a party of 3 or more. But I<br/>
certainly might have missed somebody, and I know not everybody checks<br/>
Atlas Quest, so forgive me for posting identical information here.....<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to get a sense of how many kids there will be so that we<br/>
will have enough materials and so that the activities planned match<br/>
the ages of the kids who are coming. If you are bringing kids along,<br/>
and haven't already responded to an AQ mail from me, could you please<br/>
AQ-mail me telling me how many children will be accompanying you, and<br/>
their ages? Thanks in advance for the help!<br/>
<br/>
Just for your information, here is what the kids' activities are so far:<br/>
- Outdoor toys for unstructured play (large playground balls, foam<br/>
rockets, flying disks, etc.)<br/>
- The Chocolate Game (I asked Lock Wench for the instructions!)<br/>
- Make-your-own t-shirts  with a Cootie theme, or otherwise (I'll be<br/>
providing paints and some fabric stamps, all you need to do is BRING A<br/>
BLANK T-SHIRT TO DECORATE!!!!! The color doesn't matter  whatever you<br/>
wish. But I will only be supplying fabric paint  NOT t-shirts!!!)<br/>
(And for that matter, if you are an interested adult, you too can make<br/>
a cootie t-shirt -- this particular activity has no age restrictions!)<br/>
- Some Kids-Only boxes<br/>
- Cooties!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to meeting folks in Vista!<br/>
