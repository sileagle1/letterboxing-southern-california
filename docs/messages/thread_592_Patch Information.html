arrive within 14 days.  Here is the final proof from the patch company: <br>
http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b279/tdscrafts/finalpatch.jpg<br>
The size of these patches will be 2.3 x 2.5 inches, and the cost will <br>
be $2 per patch.  I'll be responding to everyone who has e-mailed me <br>
expressing an interest in ordering a patch with the address to send <br>
orders to.  If ordering by mail, along with your payment, you will need <br>
to send a SASE with one stamp for every two patches you order.<br>
<br>
If you're going to be at the San Diego gathering on March 24th, I <br>
recommend that you pay for and receive your patch from me in person <br>
instead and save the postage. ;)<br>
<br>
If you're not going to be at the gathering and haven't e-mailed me yet, <br>
but do want to order patches, please e-mail me and I'll send you the <br>
mailing address and any other information you request.<br>
