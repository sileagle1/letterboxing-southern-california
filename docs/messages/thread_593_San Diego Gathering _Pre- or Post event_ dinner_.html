I noticed there is a location not far from the park (5 miles or so?) called "Restaurant Row" which might be another alternative for some people who want to get together for dinner either Friday or Saturday night.  Here's a link:<br/>

Looks like there are a lot of possibilities here, but since we are not from the area, I don't know enough about any of the places to pick out one in particular.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if any of the people going to the San Diego <br/>
&gt; gathering <br/>
&gt; would be interested in having dinner after the gathering? We are <br/>
&gt; going <br/>
&gt; to be down there the whole weekend, so it might be fun to have <br/>
&gt; some <br/>
&gt; extra time set aside for exchanges and what not. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I contacted a Round Table Pizza in San Diego (1221 Garnet Ave, <br/>
&gt; 92109) <br/>
&gt; and they have a banquet room which doesn't cost a thing. You just <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; to buy food. I checked into places before I realized the event was <br/>
&gt; going to be in Vista, but personally would rather meet back down <br/>
&gt; in San <br/>
&gt; Diego since our hotel is there and I think my little guy (and <br/>
&gt; probably <br/>
&gt; my big guy) will need a nap before going out on the town. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I would like to know if enough people are interested for <br/>
&gt; me to <br/>
&gt; set this up. So, what do you say? <br/>
