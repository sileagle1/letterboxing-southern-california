of those restaurants either.  As I said in response to this message <br/>
on AQ, I'd love to meet up for dinner, but San Diego is pretty far <br/>
out of my way.  Maybe the people who're staying near Vista or live <br/>
north could have dinner somewhere and the people staying or living <br/>
southward could have dinner somewhere else?  Or maybe have one dinner <br/>
Friday night like Wisconsin Hiker just said, and one Saturday, and <br/>
people can go to one or both.<br/>

&gt; We might be, but we are staying in San Marcos since it is closer to <br/>
the gathering spot.  I noticed there is a location not far from the <br/>
park (5 miles or so?) called "Restaurant Row" which might be another <br/>
alternative for some people who want to get together for dinner <br/>
either Friday or Saturday night.  Here's a link:<br/>

&gt; Looks like there are a lot of possibilities here, but since we are <br/>
not from the area, I don't know enough about any of the places to <br/>
pick out one in particular.<br/>

&gt; To: letterboxing-socal@yahoogroups.com <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if any of the people going to the San Diego <br/>
&gt; &gt; gathering <br/>
&gt; &gt; would be interested in having dinner after the gathering? We are <br/>
&gt; &gt; going <br/>
&gt; &gt; to be down there the whole weekend, so it might be fun to have <br/>
&gt; &gt; some <br/>
&gt; &gt; extra time set aside for exchanges and what not. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I contacted a Round Table Pizza in San Diego (1221 Garnet Ave, <br/>
&gt; &gt; 92109) <br/>
&gt; &gt; and they have a banquet room which doesn't cost a thing. You just <br/>
&gt; &gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; to buy food. I checked into places before I realized the event <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; &gt; going to be in Vista, but personally would rather meet back down <br/>
&gt; &gt; in San <br/>
&gt; &gt; Diego since our hotel is there and I think my little guy (and <br/>
&gt; &gt; probably <br/>
&gt; &gt; my big guy) will need a nap before going out on the town. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I would like to know if enough people are interested for <br/>
&gt; &gt; me to <br/>
&gt; &gt; set this up. So, what do you say? <br/>
