of those restaurants either.  As I said in response to this message <br>
on AQ, I'd love to meet up for dinner, but San Diego is pretty far <br>
out of my way.  Maybe the people who're staying near Vista or live <br>
north could have dinner somewhere and the people staying or living <br>
southward could have dinner somewhere else?  Or maybe have one dinner <br>
Friday night like Wisconsin Hiker just said, and one Saturday, and <br>
people can go to one or both.<br>

either Friday or Saturday night.  Here's a link:<br>
