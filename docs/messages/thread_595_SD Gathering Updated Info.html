   <br>
  I bought my shirt for Connor to decorate and Carleen (of Q and the T's) reminded me that when we have done these with our playgroup we have to put some cardboard or paper bag inside the shirt to keep the paint from bleeding through to the back. I have a couple of pieces of cardboard I am bringing to be used. <br>
   <br>
  I just thought I would share this info with you.<br>
   <br>
  Also there will be another family from our playgroup coming. They have recently started letterboxing and LOVE IT! They have just signed up to come to the gathering and would not have gotten your earlier e-mails. They have a 5 year old boy and a 2 year old girl. <br>
   <br>
  We are all very excited because this is our first gathering since we are all new to Letterboxing!<br>

There's not sand or playground in the area that we're in.  Sorry! <br>
Just lots of grass, and the duckpond right across from us!<br>
