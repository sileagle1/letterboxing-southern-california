Many of the new letterboxers may not know that there will be some <br>
special folks in attendance. If you check out the reservations you will <br>
come across 'Pete and Wanda'. These folks are from Rhode Island, but <br>
have traveled in many states planting a few but really their expertise <br>
is FINDING. If you want to get blown away just ask Wanda what her <br>
current F count is. Maybe there could be a contest to see who could get <br>
closest to their current F number. Of course you would have to think <br>
above 10,000.<br>
<br>
I posted a note on the AQ California board, but thought I would post <br>
something here as well. One of the things I plan on doing is showing <br>
how to make a smaller version of the #1 speedball blade. I call it a # <br>
1/2. If you want to leave the gathering with a #1/2 then you should <br>
bring a #1 so that it can be squeezed down.<br>
