being-- but I didn't want anyone searching for it and ending up <br/>
disappointed in the mean time.  I'd gotten notification that the <br/>
logbook was almost full, so I took my lunch to the park with a new <br/>
logbook.  Found the box first thing and then sat down to eat my lunch <br/>
while I looked through the old log.  Then, just as I was finishing my <br/>
lunch, a guy came strolling up and sat down on the next bench over, and <br/>
he showed no sign of leaving any time soon.  I couldn't wait him out <br/>
because I had to get back to work, so the box had to come with me.  <br/>
I'll do my best to get it back out there tomorrow or Friday.<br/>
