I will still be taking orders at the gathering.  I'll bring a box of <br/>

The patches are here!  And will be ready to hand out at the <br/>
gathering tomorrow!<br/>
<br/>
In fact, they were sent exactly when I was told they would be, and <br/>
who knows how long they've been here.  When I got home this <br/>
afternoon, I decided to go check our rental office just in case they <br/>
had been delivered there.  I didn't really put much hope in the <br/>
prospect, because normally when they do deliver something to the <br/>
office, they leave a note on our door telling us so.  Well, either <br/>
they didn't leave the note or it got blown away or lost somehow or <br/>
other, because the package was right there in the office just <br/>
waiting for me!<br/>
<br/>
See you all, tomorrow!<br/>

feel like a 6yo on Christmas Eve.  I decided to blow off my class entirely <br/>
and plan on being there all day!!  My boys and I drove by the park today, to <br/>
make sure we find the right place.  We found it; and are amazed we have <br/>
lived in the area for years and didn't know about this park!  I am <br/>
interested in the patch, but haven't pre ordered.  If there are enough i <br/>
would love some, if not, will be happy to order for later.  Look forward to <br/>
seeing everyone!   LMPB<br/>
