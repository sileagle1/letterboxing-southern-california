the gathering this weekend, I have some disappointing news.  The <br>
patches haven't arrived yet.  I was given the impression by the sales <br>
person I spoke with that they would get here within 14 days of when I <br>
placed my order, but that deadline has passed and they're still not <br>
here.  So unless they show up tomorrow, I won't have them to give out <br>
at the gathering.  <br>
<br>
I will still be taking orders at the gathering.  I'll bring a box of <br>
envelopes and all you'll have to do is pay me by cash or check ($2 per <br>
patch), write your name on one of the envelopes, and I will take care <br>
of the postage and send your patches to you as soon as they come.<br>
<br>
I'm really sorry about this, and very disappointed myself.<br>

The patches are here!  And will be ready to hand out at the <br>
gathering tomorrow!<br>
<br>
In fact, they were sent exactly when I was told they would be, and <br>
who knows how long they've been here.  When I got home this <br>
afternoon, I decided to go check our rental office just in case they <br>
had been delivered there.  I didn't really put much hope in the <br>
prospect, because normally when they do deliver something to the <br>
office, they leave a note on our door telling us so.  Well, either <br>
they didn't leave the note or it got blown away or lost somehow or <br>
other, because the package was right there in the office just <br>
waiting for me!<br>
<br>
See you all, tomorrow!<br>

feel like a 6yo on Christmas Eve.  I decided to blow off my class entirely <br>
and plan on being there all day!!  My boys and I drove by the park today, to <br>
make sure we find the right place.  We found it; and are amazed we have <br>
lived in the area for years and didn't know about this park!  I am <br>
interested in the patch, but haven't pre ordered.  If there are enough i <br>
would love some, if not, will be happy to order for later.  Look forward to <br>
seeing everyone!   LMPB<br>
