                    <div class="plaintext-content">Us Canadians really enjoyed the gathering too. Though it was real busy with so many people. I was disappointed to not get to meet all those I have met through the boards, or in our letterbox logbooks. And really disappointed to not get to meet and put faces to names of others we have so wanted to get to know. Next time??<br>
   <br>
  The kids had a lot of fun too!<br>
  Thank you to you all.<br>
