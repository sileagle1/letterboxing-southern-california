<br/>
WOW! What an amazing day and turnout for the event!!! I just wanted <br/>
to thank all of you who were able to come out for making such a <br/>
lovely day out of the event! You are all such wonderful, generous, <br/>
and creative folks! I had a great time meeting everybody, exchanging <br/>
stories, and seeing people's stamps and logbooks! It looked like <br/>
everyone had a really fun time.  All the smiling faces really made me <br/>
happy, and made the time and effort in planning this event more than <br/>
worth it!!<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we can do this again in another couple of years! Of course, <br/>
at the rate this sport has been growing, we'll probably have about <br/>
500 people, and I'll need to go rent out the convention center. HAHA!<br/>
<br/>
Some folks have been asking about the event boxes.  I will be posting <br/>
the clues to the GG boxes on LBNA and AQ later today so you can log <br/>
them.  I'll also post the pics I took online and will send out a link <br/>
to the attendees.<br/>
<br/>
So, THANKS AGAIN TO ALL OF YOU!!! It was really nice getting to know <br/>
other LB enthusiasts, and putting faces to the trailnames! Hope to <br/>
see you on the trails soon!! HAPPY TRAILS!!<br/>
<br/>
Always,<br/>
GG<br/>

We are so there!!!  Bella will have her own stamp and logbook by <br/>
then... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone, for such a wonderful time.  Sometimes it's hard to <br/>
take the kids to events without my husband, but this was just so <br/>
comfortable...  Ethan had a great time, he got more exchanges than I <br/>
did!  There were people I really enjoyed meeting and talking to (Mrs. <br/>
Grumpy Grinch is definitely one) that I didn't exchange with, still <br/>
being a rookie and all...  I'll be sure to get everyone next time!<br/>
<br/>
And I'm supposed to let everyone know, Ethan has his own profile on AQ <br/>
now, as Archer Boy.  <br/>

meeting all of you.  Our son, Alan, has no fear and is not shy, so<br/>
thanks to all of you whom he joined up with for periods of time, for<br/>
keeping an eye out on him.  He can't stop talking about that hill!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to RMN SD for bringing the cardboard for decorating the shirts,<br/>
for bringing extra shirts for little ones that didn't have one, and<br/>
for letting me borrow their red crate for one of the kids boxes.  And<br/>
also thanks to Pilgrimsinthisland for bringing prizes for the kids and<br/>
extra craft supplies.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if your kids have AQ accounts and want to log the kids boxes as<br/>
finds, they are listed as "Other" boxes on AQ. <br/>
<br/>
Like others have said, it was great to put faces to trail names --<br/>
sometimes people were a lot like what I had expected, and sometimes<br/>
they were absolutely not!  I missed out on the handwriting analysis --<br/>
I heard that was very interesting!  And I also missed out on Don's<br/>
carving presentation.  I'll have to check out the pictures and try to<br/>
piece together some of what I missed.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all out on the trails someday!<br/>
