                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm finally getting around to filing a brief trip report from last <br/>
weekend.  I've been working in California since mid-February on a <br/>
project that will last until the end of April.  Some weekends I work, <br/>
some I head home, and for others Martini Man comes out here so we can <br/>
do some letterboxing.  When I found out that a gathering was planned <br/>
in the San Diego area for the weekend of March 24, we figured that <br/>
would be a good weekend for some boxing and a chance to meet some <br/>
local letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Martini Man flew out Thursday night and after I attended a meeting on <br/>
Friday morning we were off to Crystal Cove State Park.  We found a <br/>
box there and also planted one (clues were posted on LBNA <br/>
yesterday).  We liked hiking the hilly trails there and enjoyed the <br/>
ocean views!  After that we scrambled along the rocks, with the waves <br/>
crashing nearby, to find the Tidepool Lighthouse box  lots of fun.  <br/>
Then it was a stop in the BUSY town of San Juan Capistrano.  It <br/>
seemed they were having a big celebration that weekend (the return of <br/>
the swallows?) and people were all over the place.  However we did <br/>
manage to find the very nicely carved Ghosts of Capistrano series.  <br/>
Then we were back on the trails to find the Friendly Ghost box (and <br/>
the Sandpiper hitchhiker!) before we called it a day.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning we headed to Rancho Bernardo to find three boxes <br/>
(Painted Rocks, Kumeyaay Indian, and Hodgee) and enjoyed this <br/>
pleasant area.  We then marveled at the colorful Queen Califia's <br/>
Magical Circle before finding the Indians of the Acorn.  After that <br/>
it was off to the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Geisha Girl met us with a nice goodie bag with carving media and <br/>
raffle ticket  a nice touch and much appreciated!  After getting our <br/>
name tags and chatting a bit, we headed over to meet some other <br/>
people.  It turned out to be Don &amp; Gwen, who we have corresponded <br/>
with a bit when planning a trip to California.  We spent the next <br/>
hour or so chatting and exchanging with several other people, <br/>
including Lee &amp; Nancy, Grumpy Grinch, Peter K. and others.  We also <br/>
were able to purchase the cool new California letterboxing patches.  <br/>
Martini Man especially enjoyed chatting with Acorn &amp; Stafish, two <br/>
very cute little girls belonging to Punky and the King of Pinecrest.  <br/>
We're thinking of heading to their neck of the woods next March.  We <br/>
brought 6 cooties to the event which we managed to slip into various <br/>
packs and only came home with one new one ourselves (Song in your <br/>
Head)  a good trade for us!  We took a short jaunt up the nearby <br/>
hill to find two boxes, then came back for more socializing.  <br/>
Wisconsin Hiker was one of the lucky raffle winners and the index <br/>
cards will be put to good use in making future box logbooks.  Next we <br/>
were pleased to go out on the trail with Tdyans and Alarch (?).  We <br/>
did the SD Sports Series, Creatures of Wonderland and Park Pleasures <br/>
series with them, juggling the various sets of clues to do them on <br/>
the same route along the stream and back.  We met Kelsung, Zuhl is <br/>
Cool and Naught Zoot(?) along the trail as they were nearing their <br/>
milestone 100th find.  Then we were back at the gathering spot where <br/>
we said our goodbyes to whoever was left and thanked Geisha Girl for <br/>
organizing such a nice event.  We headed out with Pete &amp; Wanda to <br/>
find the last series of boxes (Enchanted Forest) and even managed to <br/>
find the Longhorns box.  Then it was back to the hotel after <br/>
an "eventful" day.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday morning we headed to Iron Mountain.  It started out quite <br/>
foggy, but gradually cleared as we made our way up to the Ramona <br/>
Overlook.  By the time we got there it was a gorgeous day and view <br/>
and a great place to find Ramona Road Runner , our 2,100th box!  We <br/>
then headed over to the summit and found both the Water Works and <br/>
Iron Mountain box (and the Mille Borne Hitchhiker).  It was a busy <br/>
trail on a nice Sunday morning.  We then walked along a short nature <br/>
trail to find Cozy Camp and Dos Picos Park and stopped to stamp into <br/>
Mostly Monkeys.  We ended the day with another long hike at Volcan <br/>
Mountain where we managed to find the Apple Pie a la Mode series and <br/>
all 5 boxes in the Grumpy Grandeur series.  Quite a bit of uphill on <br/>
this hike and some great views and interesting landmarks at the top!<br/>
<br/>
Monday we only had time for a few boxes (and a lot of traffic!).  The <br/>
weather wasn't as nice, but we enjoyed finding Diamond Valley Lake, <br/>
Maze Stone (eerie place in the fog), and Signal Races.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you who place boxes in California  we appreciate <br/>
the opportunity you give us to find new places and see some of the <br/>
local spots.  Thanks also to all of you who made us feel so welcome <br/>
at the event.  It was nice to meet some of the locals who we have <br/>
seen stamped into many logbooks!<br/>

P.S.  Martini Man has sent to notes to all the placers to let them <br/>
know the status of the various boxes we found.<br/>
