  It was great to meet everyone - the time went so fast - there were many people we didn't get to chat or exchange with. Maybe next time!<br/>
<br/>
  Thank You Thank You Thank You to Geisha Girl for putting on such a great event. It really exceeded my expectations - and I had HIGH ones!<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for the carving class Don! I re-carved my Owl stamp and gave him pupils! The other one looked like Little Orphan Annie to me. I know you said, "Do the eyes first", but I was too intimidated. The new and improved Owl will be placed in Tecolote Canyon to add to the owl count. <br/>
<br/>
  Now what to do with all of these Cooties!?!<br/>
