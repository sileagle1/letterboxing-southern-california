<br>
I received a report a couple of weeks ago that my ET Phone Home LB was <br>
soaking wet.  Sure enough, when I went to check on it yesterday, it <br>
looked like it had some major flood damage, and the foam stamp was <br>
literally falling to pieces.  Guess my experimenting with foam and glue <br>
is coming to an end.  I recarved a new one with a similar image and <br>
have replace the box with something a little more sturdy.  <br>
<br>
I also found Zoofamily's Coyote Trail box and janixg's Eve of Christmas <br>
box.  Had the be a little stealthy for the latter one, but it worked <br>
out in the end... Both boxes are alive and very healthy!!!<br>
