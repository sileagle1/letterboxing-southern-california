Karen our (Gwen &amp; Don) letterboxes in Long Beach, Signal Hill, and <br/>
Seal Beach would be fine. Other nearby boxes by Kelsung,Tdyans, and <br/>
Chowder all should be near enough for you. Seal Beach is on the <br/>

Ca. LbNA map. There are some boxes in the San Pedro area as well.<br/>

  In answer to your request about good boxes with children:<br/>
  We have a 4 year old and just were up in Long Beach in February to meet up with my Dad and Step-Mother coming in from a cruise before they flew home the next day. We were only up overnight, but hit several boxes with them. The El Dorado Nature Center (Don and Gwen's) was probably the most enjoyable one for our son. We also found their Signal Hill Letterbox and enjoyed it's non-traditional hiding place as well as the awesome view. Speaking of Chowder's boxes - we found the Marina Pacifica Plumbing Problem and the Naples Canal Conundrum (Loved walking by the Gorgeous Homes along the canal after finding the box). Both of these were quick and easy finds. I hope this helps!<br/>
