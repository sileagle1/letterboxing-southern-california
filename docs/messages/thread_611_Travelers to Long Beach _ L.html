is late, but if you're still looking for a box to hunt in Hollywood, <br>
check out To the Batcave! It's a short hike, a neat area that kids <br>
would like, and has a great view of the Hollywood sign.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately one of the boxes is missing, but the other one should be <br>
alive and well. Also, I don't think this area was hit too bad by the <br>
recent wildfire.<br>
