<br>
I have a dilemma.  I love to carve & make logbooks, but I hate <br>
planting.  Lately, I've taken to just making Hitchhikers.  Is there <br>
anyone out there who hates to carve but loves to plant?  I'd be willing <br>
to set up some kind of arrangement that would benefit us both.  You'd <br>
venture out in the wilds and plant the box, you'd be the owner, but I'd <br>
be listed as the carver.  Any takers?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Kristie<br>
