Hi! I'm the young adult librarian at Palm Desert Library and my summer <br>
reading program has a mystery theme. One of the components is maps and <br>
buried treasure, and in our manual it suggests letterboxing. This was <br>
new to me but what an exciting concept! I'd like to include something <br>
in my summer program. Are there any letterboxers in the Palm Desert-<br>
Palm Springs area who would be willing to come to the library and do a <br>
talk/presentation w/ stamp making and finding a letterbox? Thanks.<br>
