  It is in Tecolote Canyon and can be done with the Owl series (Who's Hoo?).<br>
  It is fun for kids because there is a rope swing at the destination.<br>
  It is an easy hike - but there are no bathroom facilities at this location (as is the case with several of the Tecolote Canyon hikes).<br>

This park looks like a great "catch" for many boxes with the kids. <br>
Will a stroller be able to do this park or do I need the backpack for<br>
the baby?  I'd rather carry the baby weight on my back instead of my<br>
arms if I'm gonna have to carry him!<br>

There's nothing strenuous, but I think the trails would be tough with a <br>
stroller.<br>
