has had a few members either stop letterboxing, change their email <br/>
address or just not picking up their mail. Instead of just deleting <br/>
their membership I just switched them over to "No Mail" so that I won't <br/>
keep getting notices. Obviously if you are reading this then you aren't <br/>
one of those folks.<br/>
