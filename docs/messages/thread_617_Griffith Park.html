I'm pretty sure what's left of my Idiot Box series is gone - the fire <br>
is right there.<br>
<br>
I saw a picture of one of the cages in the Old Zoo picnic area on fire. <br>
So anybody who was at the Old Zoo gathering will remember the cages, <br>
they were right behind where our picnic table was. :(<br>
