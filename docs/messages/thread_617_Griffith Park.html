&gt; Hi-<br/>
&gt; From the reports we have been getting on that fire I<br/>
&gt; would say that some of the boxes will have most likely<br/>
&gt; been effected. They have let a huge portion of the<br/>
&gt; hill burn only protecting the zoo, observatory and<br/>
&gt; homes in the area. I don't know if they will be<br/>
&gt; letting anyone over there this weekend or not. If I<br/>
&gt; get any more news I will let everyone know. <br/>

and I have been in my share of foothill fires), I only meant I would <br/>
check on the boxes I think were affected if possible.  Sounds like <br/>
all the access roads are closed anyway.  I'm not in L.A. very often <br/>

I'm pretty sure what's left of my Idiot Box series is gone - the fire <br/>
is right there.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a picture of one of the cages in the Old Zoo picnic area on fire. <br/>
So anybody who was at the Old Zoo gathering will remember the cages, <br/>
they were right behind where our picnic table was. :(<br/>
