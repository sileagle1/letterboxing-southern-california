We just came home from our weekend in LA.  What a whirlwind trip!  We<br/>
didn't get to too many letterboxes, but the ones we did were *great*!<br/>
 Thank you for your help in finding some nice spots, we look forward<br/>
to our next visit.<br/>
<br/>
The kid's absolute fave box was the abalone cove tide pools.  One of<br/>
the two boxes was missing, but the pools were amazing!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Karen<br/>
