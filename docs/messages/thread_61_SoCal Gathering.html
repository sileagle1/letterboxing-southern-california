We haven't advanced as far as considering dates as yet. At this <br>
point, it's only in the dreaming stage. <br>
<br>
At the SLO Event, 20 new letterboxes were placed in park just for <br>
event day, then retrieved that evening after the end of the event. I <br>
envisioned something similar for El Dorado, not only to provide a lot <br>
of boxes for event-goers to find, but to make it more interesting for <br>
those of us who have already found your boxes at this location <br>
(actually, I'm still missing two of yours).  I'd like to plant a <br>
couple in the Nature Park, but wouldn't want to go against the <br>
explicit wishes of the park manager, who apparently doesn't approve <br>
of such things (going against the implicit wishes is a different <br>
matter).  This is a pretty big park, maybe there still are some good <br>
hiding places left on the non-Nature Park side--Doughnut and I might <br>
need to check that out.  Do you know of another park in greater Los <br>
Angeles similar in size, diversity and interest as El Dorado?  EUREKA-<br>
-Griffith Park seems like the logical choice!!<br>

No one advised me not to plant any there either. Gwen and I scoured the park pretty thoroughly when we had the problem of purloined boxes. We ended up using many of the same locations and just waited for about 3 months before we pulled the MIA note on the clue page. <br>

Have never been there, but I would imagine it would provide ample places for <br>
letterboxes.  How about safety issues?  It has never struck me as a place one <br>
would want to go tramping around alone, as I always invision scary people <br>
hanging out there with nefarious intent, probably because it is much closer to the <br>
"big city" than I am used to.  Have you ever been there? Are my imagings <br>
anywhere close to reality?<br>
<br>
With the equestrian center and Traveltown there, we could get some <br>
interesting horse and railroad-themed stamps. . .<br>

Griffith Park is lovely. And every weekend is filled with families <br>
enjoying the picnic tables and barbecues, and trails, and TravelTown, <br>
and train rides, and Merry-Go-Rounds, etc.  I think it's the largest <br>
urban park in the U.S., though I may be mistaken.  There are two <br>
letterboxes already residing in the park: "Two Cats and a Troll" <br>
(planted by Hamish Macbeth and Cousine Knueppe), which is located in <br>
a beautiful fern dell, and "The Mount Hollywood Letterbox" (planted <br>
by Mandrill), which requires a 2 mile hike to the top of Mount <br>
Hollywood from its trailhead in the Park; this letterbox was <br>
immortalized as part of the (in)famous Pandy "Trip of Doom" (don't <br>
worry, Pandy didn't break her ankle here, that happened in Pasadena--<br>
I could tell you a letterboxing yarn about this incident.  Griffith <br>
Park is so big and diverse, you could hide a hundred boxes here, let <br>
loose forty letterboxers, and not see a single one during the day. <br>
<br>
That said, the French Hen thought of another fine park located closer <br>
to home (your and my home), and that is Brookside Park in Pasadena.  <br>
It's the home of the Rose Bowl, and an aquatic center, and a golf <br>
course, and hiking trails, and a casting pond, etc.  And it is in the <br>
historic Arroyo Grande, and would probably be a wonderful place for a <br>
gathering, though I'd want to check it out more completely, because <br>
I've never really explored it by foot.<br>
