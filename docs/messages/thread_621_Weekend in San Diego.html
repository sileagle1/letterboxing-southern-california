<br/>
A must see on the way to or from the Wild Animal Park<br/>
is Indians of the Acorn.  The Queen Califia's Magic<br/>
Circle sculpture garden is one of a kind!  General<br/>
Andres Pico is just past the WAP.  We haven't been<br/>
there yet, but it is a Don &amp; Gwen box so it has to be<br/>
special.  Just off of the I-15 in Rancho Bernardo (on<br/>
the way to or from the WAP) are 3 easy boxes:  Hodgee,<br/>
Painted Rocks, and Kumeyaay Indian.  Vacation<br/>
Series-CA is a lot longer walk.  There are several<br/>
boxes just off of I-5 near Sorrento: Mr. Natural,<br/>
Pottery Canyon, Windandsea, and A Long Shot.   Near<br/>
the Torrey Pines Golf course is San Diego Sails (have<br/>
to pay a fee to park).  Are  you coming down or going<br/>
home on I-5?  From the southbound side of I-5 are USMC<br/>
#1 and Pacific Coast Highway Series #1 and on the<br/>
northbound are Batiquitos Lagoon and I-5 Hippy Love<br/>
Van.  There are also all of the boxes in Vista off of<br/>
Hwy 78 that were planted during the gathering in<br/>
March.  Closer to downtown and off of I-5 and Hwy 52<br/>
there are 8 boxes in Clairemont Mesa in Tecolote<br/>
Canyon that you can get in a morning if you start<br/>
early:  the 6 in Who's who series, Winnie the Poohs's<br/>
Search for Owl and How many licks?  <br/>
<br/>
If you need anymore, there are still a few almost<br/>
drive-bys.<br/>
