to move a bit farther out of the city limits to get a few more great <br>
boxes.  Lately though there have been a great number of new plants <br>
popping up here in So Cal.  Maybe if you start the trend in Fullerton <br>
you will start a great avalanche of plants in your area !  IT COULD <br>
HAPPEN!  <br>

<br>
You might want to recheck LbNA as there is a 3 box series listed in <br>
Fullerton. In case you are going directly to "Search for Boxes", you <br>
should instead just click on the book on the home page, then click on <br>
California, then click on the bottom of the Ca. map. That will bring up <br>
a listing of letterboxes in Orange Co, and San Diego Co.<br>
Just scroll down to Fullerton.<br>
<br>
LbNA and AQ are the two sites that host most of the letterbox clues. <br>
There are other clues hidden in various spots and there are some that <br>
are WOM (word of mouth).<br>
<br>
 Since you are new to letterboxing I would suggest that you check some <br>
of the tutorials, FAQ sheets, and Code of Conduct listed at LbNA, Atlas <br>
Quest, and Letterbox info. I have posted links to these sites.<br>
<br>
Don<br>
<br>
 Letterboxing.org:<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html<br>
<br>
Silent Doug's site:<br>
http://www.letterboxing.info/<br>
Doug probably has the best info site on Hitchhikers and links to <br>
regional chatlists.<br>
<br>
AtlasQuest:<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/<br>
Ryan has a link set up "Code of Conduct" that is really good for all<br>
boxers to read<br>
<br>
newboxers' group:<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br>
Where there is no dumb question, and is "the" place for many<br>
newletterboxers.<br>
