I'm posting this as a request to anyone who hides LBs, especially if<br>
you post on the listing that you want us to contact you if there are<br>
problems with your box.  It's really hard to contact you if your<br>
e-mail address is dead :-p  I tried for a week to contact a hider<br>
about a box in Ventura County, but I kept getting Mailer Daemons that<br>
the address was "indisposed".  After a week of this, I have to assume<br>
that the addy is defunct.  I realize that some hiders don't want any<br>
e-mail at all about their boxes, an attitude that I cannot understand,<br>
but this isn't about them.  This is about people who have expressed an<br>
interest in hearing from seekers.   Please check that the listing site<br>
has your current e-mail address.  Thank you!<br>
<br>
Hope everyone has a nice summer :-)  We'll be going to Yellowstone<br>
just after Labor Day, so the crowds will be low (we hope).  With luck<br>
we'll grab a few boxes along the way.<br>

be okay, but we won't be receiving any while we are on our summer "Beat <br>

If any of you see something not quite right on this list then you can <br>
contact Ca. Bear (owner) or Ryan, aka Green Tortuga (moderator).<br>
I'll be around until 6/26.<br>
