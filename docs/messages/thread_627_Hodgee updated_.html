<br>
Just thought I'd let you know that I replaced the Hodgee logbook today, <br>
so log away!!<br>
<br>
Also, we found the Ranch Penasquitos Waterfall box today!! It was a bit <br>
challenging as the area has changed somewhat since the clues were <br>
written, but it was very much worth it!!  Just a note to anyone who may <br>
want to go find it, Camino Ruiz is now Camino Del Mar.  I'll contact <br>
the placer to give him/her the details...<br>
<br>
Happy 4th!<br>
GG<br>
