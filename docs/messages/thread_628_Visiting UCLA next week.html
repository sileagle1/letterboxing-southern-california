My son will be starting at UCLA next Fall, so I will be spending a fair <br/>
amount of time in the LA area (currently residing in San Jose).  He has <br/>
Orientation next week, and I will have a few days with mostly free <br/>
time - Wed 15th and Thurs the 16th.  I will be staying in the LAX area, <br/>
and shuttling back and forth to the UCLA campus.  Anyone up for meeting <br/>
up?  And what "must have" boxes should I be looking for?  Especially <br/>
those that might help familiarize me with the campus.  Thanks in <br/>
advance!<br/>

<br/>
Also, not too far from campus, you might enjoy the Getty box.  The <br/>
box is really cleverly hidden basically in plain sight.  Also, the <br/>
Getty is a fun trip in itself.<br/>
<br/>
Down closer to LAX, the Baldwin Hills series is in a nice location, <br/>
though I think some of the boxes are reported missing.  <br/>
