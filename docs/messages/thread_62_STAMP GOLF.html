<br>
The start of the Stamp Golf game is at Deukmejian Drive and Federation Drive at the entrance road to the Long Beach Recreation Golf Course (18 holes).  To reach the golf course from the 405 (San Diego Freeway) take the 7th St. (22) off ramp and head west past Cal State Long Beach to Park Avenue and turn north (right).  At 10th St. turn right onto Deukmejian Drive.  You will be passing our alma mater, Wilson High School class of '60-Go Bruins!  Restrooms are at Recreation Park near corner of 7th and Park.  This course is stroller friendly and you can take your pooch too.<br>
<br>
Before proceeding with the clues for the 8 hole Stamp golf game you must read the various wavers and realize that you or your parked vehicle can be hit with errant real golf balls from the neighboring game.  Stamp golf has hazards too!<br>
<br>
Research the various forms of measurements and realize that paces, however long they are may be, are not used in this game so prepare prior to setting out by reading the clues and getting your equivalents.<br>
<br>
You must also read and adhere to the Rules for Stamp Golf and must accept this game as a Life and Death Struggle and maintain the decorum that this game requires.<br>
As for the proper attire:  Main stream golfers wear cleeted shoes and lawn bowlers wear white clothing so Stamp golfers need to wear their uniforms:  backpack, cutoffs, ratty T shirt and baseball hat will be fine.<br>
<br>
The terrain is flat and grassy with occasional road crossings; the length is about 1 1/2 miles round trip and will require about 7200 seconds to complete.<br>
<br>
The goal of the game is to finish the course with one readable stamp using the least amount of strokes.  The finished stamp covers an area of about 4" x 4 1/2" so bring a big piece of paper if your journal is smaller than the size of the completed image.  Each hole has a piece of the total image and should be lined up in your journal 1,2, 3, 4 across the top and 5, 6, 7, 8 across the bottom.  Number 5 will be directly under # 1, # 6 will be under # 2, # 7 will be under # 3 and # 8 will be under # 4. Got it?  Each leg equals one stroke and rechecking of legs counts additional strokes.  Par for this course is 17.<br>
<br>
 Stamp Golf Rules<br>
<br>
1. Move away from metal objects when taking compass headings.<br>
2. No cursing, spitting, threatening gestures or evil thoughts while playing the game; stay focused on the purity of the game.<br>
3. Safety of the Placers is the main concern.   All finders are on their own (see waver).  <br>
4. Discretion of Players (Finders) is required.<br>
5. Improper re-hiding of stamp pieces will result in stamp loss and will ruin the game for subsequent players-.not good form at all!<br>
6. Multiple inking without wiping is not allowed.<br>
7. Advising other finders of locations, clue explanation either verbally or written will result in loss of enjoyment.  No gimmes.<br>
8. Definitely come with a friend or group but all players should have their own clue sheet to minimize arguments.<br>
9. No twisting of one's knickers or someone else's for that matter..<br>
10. No running from hole to hole.  Remember to retrieve discreetly without taunting, such as "Na, na, I found it".<br>
11. The stamp pieces are in micro boxes so leave your hitchhikers at home.<br>
12. Snacking and picnicking are allowed.<br>
13. All strokes will be counted on the honor system, but cheat if you must.<br>
14. When completing this series with all 8 pieces your stamp count will be increased by ONE.  Failure to complete the series will leave your stamp count in fractions.  Now, you don't want that do you?<br>
15. To record your success and prowess or whine to us, you may file your score and comments on either the LBNA So Cal talk list or the main LBNA talk list.  Other databases may not be used.<br>
16. It is acceptable to go to Joe Jost's on Anaheim and Temple for a beer and "Joe's Special" sandwich or treat yourself to ice cream after the search. <br>
17. Prior to posting one must read the R.S. Carpenter course for discourse.<br>
18. How long is a Pace?  2 footfalls, 6 feet who cares, anyway, you don't need a pace for this hunt.<br>
19. There are no rules.<br>
<br>

Look for my last letterbox series plant for a while to be published <br>
here this afternoon.  I promised the French Hen that I'd spend more <br>
time concentrating on the holidays instead of planting or finding  <br>
letterboxes.<br>
