our "Anniversary/Western Divide Letterbox" yesterday as her cousins <br/>
from the UK were here celebrating their first anniversary, and we <br/>
decided what better spot to take them to.<br/>
<br/>
The high country around Kernville is absolutely beautiful this time of <br/>
year and the leaves are just starting to turn. The temps were in the <br/>
low 60s for most of the day and while there were a few folks walking <br/>
about in the big trees, nary a soul could be found at our hidden <br/>
waterfall.<br/>
<br/>
There have been a few stampins at the letterbox and it was really <br/>
surprising how many of them were celebrating their anniversary as well.<br/>
Celebrating an annivesary isn't really a requirement for this letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
This LB is our first plant and while the location is pretty spectacular <br/>
the stamp is pretty so-so.<br/>
<br/>
In a few months this box and others up there will be snowed in for the <br/>
winter so if anyone is planning on the trip after the OC Gathering on <br/>
October 13 make sure you check in here or check with the Forest Service <br/>
for road conditions.<br/>
<br/>
All you folks have fun in Huntington Beach and even though we will miss <br/>
this one we will try to make sure our Seal Beach Town Tour is up to <br/>
speed and try to replace the logbook in Dogs Mandatory.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Gwen and I did some maintenance on our High Country boxes. These are 3 <br/>
season boxes and after the first snowfall most of the back country <br/>
roads get shut.<br/>
Right now and for the next few months is a perfect time to head up <br/>
there. Temps in Kernville are still at 90 degrees but up higher it is <br/>
20 degrees cooler. It is deer season for the next few weeks but after <br/>
then there are hardly any folks up there. By then there should be some <br/>
color changes as well.<br/>
<br/>
(I've seen more deer on our property than in the mountains!)<br/>
<br/>
The boxes we checked on are on the Western Divide Hwy going from <br/>
Kernville to Springville.<br/>
