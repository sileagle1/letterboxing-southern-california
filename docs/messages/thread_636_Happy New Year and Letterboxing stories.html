Just got an amazing story about one of my letterboxes. Had to share <br>
it. My box is called Blast off and it's a cartoon rocket stamp near <br>
Kennedy Space Center's Astronaut Hall of Fame.  Here's the message:<br>
Message: <br>
Hi there,  Just wanted to let you know that we found your box on <br>
December 20, 2007.  And... WHILE I WAS STAMPING, my husband <br>
says, "Joanne, look up!" and there, up in the sky, was a rocket!  How <br>
cool is that!  Thanks for the memory!<br>
<br>
Reminds me of the time I found a hitchhiker called "Julie's 40" <br>
celebrating her 40th's birthday. I found it on my 40th birthday! <br>
<br>
I'm sure some of you have similar stories...please share<br>

Okay, here is one that happened this last summer. We were on our <br>
summer 'escape the heat' trip. We had planted a few, found a bunch, but <br>
hadn't planted very many around the area south of Hood River. We were <br>
on our way back from some really cool letterboxes around a small lake <br>
when we spotted a sign for a waterfall. <br>
<br>
I had precarved a pretty neat stamp so we pulled off the main road and <br>
headed up to the waterfall.<br>
The road ended at an old CCC made bridge. The road was blocked by some <br>
large boulders. We parked and checked out the falls that were just <br>
above the bridge with the creek formed by the falls flowing under the <br>
bridge.<br>
<br>
The falls were pretty spectacular and the old bridge was pretty neat <br>
and I started looking around for a planting site. I found a large prone <br>
log laying next to the road. That log would be easily identifiable so I <br>
started poking around the log. At the down hill side of the very end of <br>
the log I slipped and went down on my butt. I layed there for a second <br>
or two just surveying any damage. I checked my hand and there was some <br>
brown goo. Closer inspection revealed that it wasn't brown goo.<br>
<br>
You guessed it..it wasn't goo. it was poop. Not just any poop either, <br>
but this was of the human kind. Pretty stinky too.<br>
 Getting up rather quickly now, I went over to our truck and asked Gwen <br>
if she would get me the paper towels and some water. She helped me wash <br>
the stuff off of my hands.<br>
She then asked if I had an extra pair of pants, and looking down saw a <br>
small spot on the front. I told her I could wash that off, and her <br>
reply was "do you have an extra pair of pants?".<br>
<br>
I dug out the extra shorts I had and changed pants finally seeing the <br>
back side of the pants I was wearing..yep it was covered!<br>
<br>
Putting them into a trashbag, they went into the back of the truck.<br>
<br>
Moral...Don't poke around on the downhill side of prone logs.<br>
<br>
<br>
The letterbox didn't get planted. It would have required a different <br>
image for the stamp.<br>
<br>
Gwen was really cool she didn't even crack a smile.<br>

Don that is just sad!  But, think of the bright side. If Gwen hadn't been so helpful, you <br>
would've just washed your hands and hopped into the truck....<br>
On the other hand, THAT would have been the perfect  excuse to buy a new truck.   <br>
<br>
Happy New Year, everyone!<br>
