Has anybody been thinking or talking about a So Cal gathering lately? <br>
<br>
Been thinking of coming down to So Cal way to do some letterbox <br>
maintenance on my Mission Series and of course bag some of those <br>
wonderful boxes in that area. I'm sure I'll hit several missions <br>
coming North. So was wondering if there's been anybody thinking of a <br>
gathering in So Cal?  I'd like to plan to attend if so. I pretty much <br>
need to go from San Diego clear up to Solvang, so any place in between <br>
works for me. <br>
<br>
Hope everybody has a great letterboxing year.... may all your boxing <br>
trips be fruitful. <br>
<br>
Sierra Sally<br>

Hi Sally,<br>
Haven't heard anything except the crickets in here lately! It's nice to know you're replacing <br>
some of your Mission series. I have about four of them  and searched for another three or <br>
four that were missing before I got to them. Nice series, I'll look forward to finding more of <br>
them : )<br>

<br>
I just got the Solvang box on boxing day last week. I actually got the<br>
logbook to send to you because it desperately needed to be dried out<br>
and there was a self addressed stamped envelope in there, but after I<br>
got it home I realized that I don't think it is yours! (The return<br>
address is The Five Seas...) So I still have the logbook. I live in<br>
Ventura, so you could either pick it up to replace it when you do<br>
maintenance work on the Mission here or I could send it to you via<br>
snail mail. I left sheets of sketchbook paper in there, but it really<br>
does need a new logbook. Unfortunately I didn't have an extra with me<br>
at the time.<br>

maybe something could be planned...<br>
