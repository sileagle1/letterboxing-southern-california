Servatius on AQ.<br>
I realize most of you are probably scratching your heads wondering who <br>
that might be.<br>
When Gwen and I started letterboxing I went back through the LbNA <br>
archives to the start of the chatlist and didn't find all of the <br>
information I was looking for. At the time some conversations took <br>
place off list and there were a few holes in the information. This <br>
interview helped fill in some of the holes.<br>
<br>
You can reach the interview by going to AQ and looking for it <br>
under "Letterbox news" on the righthand side of the page.<br>
