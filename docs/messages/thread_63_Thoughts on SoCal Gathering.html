It is indeed huge and full of far too many places to plant boxes for any<br/>
sane individual... or group for that matter. I suggested it as a "maybe next<br/>
year" project when it was brought up with our group. On the weekends, it is<br/>
often very crowded in the picnic areas and hiking trails, particularly the<br/>
ones that go where vehicles are banned. During the week, it is practically<br/>
dead except near the zoo and playground near the merry-go-round, where<br/>
school groups can be found. I would strongly advise against going there at<br/>
night alone - or even with others - it's a different and dangerous place,<br/>
despite the best efforts of the park rangers to clean it up.<br/>
<br/>
My main concern about Griffith would be it's size. We could restrict things<br/>
to just one area to ensure we do run into one another, but that loses some<br/>
of the excitement of the place. If the boxes are spread out so that a good<br/>
portion of the park's areas can be visited, we may not see one another - as<br/>
Buzzard already pointed out. Have we considered a moving boxing gathering?<br/>
We pre-arrange that at certain times, we'll meet in key areas to swap stamps<br/>
and get clues to boxes planted nearby. Just a thought on how to make that<br/>
park work.<br/>
<br/>
Brookside Park -<br/>
<br/>
I too have never explored it on foot, though I've driven through areas of it<br/>
and found it fairly quiet except on event days at the Rose Bowl. If others<br/>
are interested, I don't mind making a drive out there myself to look for<br/>
possible boxing locations.<br/>
<br/>
In either case, I'm excited about the idea of a local gathering, pretty much<br/>
regardless of the park selected, so long as it's the greater LA area :) I've<br/>
yet to talk any of the kids into going, but perhaps once I get someone (Nik<br/>
is the most involved) hyped about planting special boxes, the interest will<br/>
overpower the shyness.<br/>

Right you are--we wouldn't want to hang around Griffith park after <br/>
dark, but that goes for a lot of parks.  You're right about the size <br/>
of Griffith Park being both a strength and a weakness:  many <br/>
interesting hiding places, but we may not see each other all day.  <br/>
Brookside Park is of a much more manageable size, but may not have <br/>
enough diversity--a lot of the park is taken up by a golf course--<br/>
and, thanks to Don &amp; Gwen, we already have stamp golf going on in <br/>
Long Beach.  I live in Pasadena, so Brookside is right in my back <br/>
yard, and easy for me to check out and report.  An advantage that <br/>
both parks have is they do not charge for parking.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think Griffith is a bit on the large side.  There are a couple of other regional parks in the LA area.  There's  one in La Mirada and one in Carson.  I've never been to the one in Carson and its been a long time since I've been to the one in La Mirada but I believe it wasn't quite as big as El Dorado and definitely not as big as Griffith.<br/>
