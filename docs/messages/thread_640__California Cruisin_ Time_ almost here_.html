                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings SoCal Letterboxers!<br>
<br>
Recently Sierra Sally suggested that it might be a good idea to mention that our "Loveboat <br>
Letterboxing Cruise III" is coming up very soon - Irene and l will be leaving from CT and RI <br>
in just a bit over a week! It seems that all those incredibly sweet deals (starting at $179) <br>
for  suites aboard the "Monarch of the Seas" got snapped up long ago by non-letterboxers <br>
(all "Sold Out"!), but there's still a possibility we could meet up with a few letterboxers <br>
along the way, if anyone is available for a "mini-meet"! <br>
<br>
I'll have the "Loveboat Letterboxing Cruise" event stamp with me for the duration of our <br>
trip, so anyone who can catch us anywhere along the line is welcome to stamp in! Probably <br>
the first such opportunity (other than if anyone happened to be up in Ventura over the <br>
weekend) would be at the San Diego B St. Pier, as we get off the ship around 8AM on <br>
Tuesday, Jan. 29th, and head off in search of "Euterpe". We would certainly love it if any <br>
area letterboxers could come take us under their wings and help us get to a few other <br>
letterboxes around town, but if that doesn't happen, well, we'll just do touristy things!<br>
<br>
The following days we also get off the cruise ship at 8AM in Avalon and Ensenada, but <br>
probably the best time to catch us would be as we disembark back at San Pedro on Friday <br>
morning, Feb. 1st, or anytime that day actually, since we're not flying back to New England <br>
until early the next morning. Again, left to our own devices, we'd probably just do a few <br>
touristy things, like taking a bus to the Getty Center, Hollywood, or downtown, but if <br>
anyone cares to join us, or help us get to any of the greater LA area "letterboxing spots", <br>
we'd be absolutely delighted!  Just let us know, swap cell phone numbers, and hopefully <br>
we can get together!  We do hope to find at least as many letterboxes on this West Coast <br>
"letterboxing cruise"  as we did on our two previous East Coast "letterboxing cruises" <br>
(which wasn't very many - just about half a dozen while cruising and another dozen or so <br>
before and after!), so any help anyone out there can give us will be really appreciated, <br>
especially seeing as we're probably going to be feeling like "fish out of water", and it's <br>
always good to see a few friendly  letterboxing faces in unfamiliar places! <br>
<br>
Cheers & thanks,<br>

Well, Irene and I are hoping to make the 5:30PM mass at Mission San Buenaventura on <br>
Saturday, Jan. 26th, so if you want to come find us, just look in the courtyard either before or <br>
after that! ( I'll be the one in the black flowered hat, discreetly examining the shrubbery!)<br>
It seems the other boxes that were in Ventura are now probably all missing, but if anyone <br>
cares to help us plant a few replacements, please do come join us!  Same goes for Friday, <br>
Feb. 1st, when we're back in the LA area after our cruise. Many of the boxes we had hoped to <br>
go looking for, like the "Bat Cave" and "Lost Luggage" now seem to be lost, but we're certainly <br>
willing to take suggestions from the locals on which boxes would be best for us to go looking <br>
for in our limited time, and we do hope to plant something at each of our ports of call, too! <br>
So, once again, please join us if you can, or at least send us some suggestions!<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Wanda from RI<br>

missed those clues, since I still almost always forget to check Atlas Quest! When I checked <br>
there just now, though, I found something else that piqued my interest: a clue called "Heaven <br>
at sea", for which we might just qualify? Please let us know if we're on the "right ship"!<br>
<br>
And as far as going batty, we just might be doing that, too! A young letterboxing friend of <br>
ours, 12-year-old Justin from Massachusetts (T2 of the Travelers 4), has been carving up a <br>
storm lately, including our newest sig stamp, so - who knows?- maybe there will be a bat <br>
trying to slip into my pack when we go up to MA tomorrow to visit!  Just a word of warning: <br>
anything that I find slipped into my pack will probably end up going to CA with us and then <br>
get left behind as a "stowaway" on one of the stops we'll be making along the West Coast! <br>
<br>
Looking forward to some slightly warmer weather after the last few nights we've had here in <br>
the low teens! Flying off to CA in just a couple of days....<br>

going to leave one in Ensenada for you guys since I read that you were<br>
going, but we never found the right place. And it will be slightly<br>
warmer, but it was in the 40s here today. And stormy/rainy. Brrrrr.<br>
And they say it will last the week.<br>
