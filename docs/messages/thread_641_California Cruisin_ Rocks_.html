taking me several days to get my "land legs" back, so I'm not going to write much now, but <br>
reading our recently posted clues for the boxes we were able to plant while out there might <br>
give some idea of our trip.  Irene is putting together a lovely scrapbook incorporating both <br>
the touristy things and letterboxing we got to do along the way.  Best of all was getting to <br>
meet up with Mary and Nico for some fine letterboxing in sunny San Diego on Tuesday <br>
afternoon, and having a wonderful time  with Don and Gwen in the Long Beach area after we <br>
got off the ship on Friday! Thanks so much, guys, for helping to make our trip extra special!<br>

Cheers,<br>

combination of rain and cranky ill toddler doesn't make it easy for mom to<br>
get away. I really would have liked to! I'm so pleased you had a wonderful<br>
time!<br>
