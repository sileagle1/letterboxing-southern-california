There is going to be an Instructors Certification course April 18, <br>
19,and 20th and the "wanta be" instructors need practice students that <br>
have never had any instruction in shooting.<br>
<br>
If you or anyone you know would like to become a practice student for <br>
this class you can call Jim Porter at 714 271 0112.<br>
<br>
You would have to pay for your own ammunition and targets.<br>
<br>
This is a good opportunity for novices and anyone thinking about <br>
learning about gun safety and how to shoot a shotgun.<br>
