We had an unusually hot few days, due to a semi-stable high-pressure<br>
cell hanging over the coast.  There were areas along the beaches that<br>
were actually hotter than many inland areas, which is not at all the<br>
norm.  Hiking, even driving, was just about impossible to even<br>
contemplate, let alone do; we spent most of Saturday at a Celtic<br>
Festival, in the shade.  Looks like the cell broke up about the time<br>
you folks went back to the hills :-o  It's been very pleasant since<br>
Tuesday, and this weekend bodes well.  As they say, Timing Is<br>
Everything :-)  Sorry you came down at the wrong time, but I'm sure<br>
that things will "improve" later in the summer :-p<br>
