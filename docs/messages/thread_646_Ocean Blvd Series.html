in a while, as the postings have gotten sparse.  Just wanted to say<br/>
that, after a lot of slacking, I've been trying to get my old plants<br/>
back up to speed, as well as put out a few fresh ones.<br/>
<br/>
I recently replanted my Ocean Blvd Series in Long Beach.  I just<br/>
wanted to draw attention to them, because I'm hearing more firmly<br/>
these days that Acres Of Books may soon be no more.  Please visit this<br/>
beloved landmark before it goes the way of the dodo.<br/>
