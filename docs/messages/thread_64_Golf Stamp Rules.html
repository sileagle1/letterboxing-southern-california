This one was for the previous "rant" you mentioned in your post. I'm not sure if you have checked the Millard Falls clues since the "accident" but I stuck my tongue in the cheek for that one too. Many of the Stamp Golf rules relate to areas, past and present in the community of letterboxing. Don<br/>
