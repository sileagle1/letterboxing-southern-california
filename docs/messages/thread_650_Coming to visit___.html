I am there for the Acro-Gymnastics Western Regional Championships, <br>

<br>
I'll be down in Seal Beach this weekend and up in the Whittier area <br>
during the day Thurs through Sunday.<br>
<br>
I won't have any stamping stuff with me as this is a shooting weekend <br>
at Triple B range.<br>
<br>
Hope you get some exchanges.<br>
