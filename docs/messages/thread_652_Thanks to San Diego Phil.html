                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were delighted to receive a report today from San Diego Phil on two <br>
of our letterboxes in the Poway area.  We hadn't heard of their fate <br>
since last year's fires in that area.  Ramona Road Runner is alive and <br>
well.  Water Works has its stamp intact but the logbook is missing and <br>
the box is broken.  We hope to get there later this year to replace the <br>
logbook and box.  If another letterboxer should beat us to it, we would <br>
be very grateful<br>
