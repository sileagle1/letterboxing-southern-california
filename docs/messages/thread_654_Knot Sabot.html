Welcome Hansenclan.<br/>
We are in the very Northern reaches of SoCal. Kernville is where we <br/>
hang our hat 80% of the time. The balances is split between Seal <br/>
Beach and on the road.<br/>
I think you will find there are letterboxers spread out through the <br/>
general LA area, a cluster in Orange Co. and several in San Diego.<br/>

Welcome!  I'm a bit south of you, northeast of Long Beach.  I think<br/>
you'll find plenty of people in your area.  Vienna has been very<br/>
actively planting boxes in that area lately.  And I don't know if<br/>
Buzzard is around anymore, but check out any of his boxes that are<br/>
still active in that area.<br/>
<br/>
Just when I'd thought this list had fizzled out, we've had as much<br/>
activity in the last few weeks as in the previous several months. <br/>
Nice to see faces new and old poking out.  I'm guessing we have a lot<br/>
of people who just lurk without posting, just checking in once in a<br/>
while to see if anything new is here.  I'm guilty of that.<br/>
<br/>
So if you popped in today and read this post, don't just breeze by:<br/>
reply!  Like the Who's only Horton could hear, just post "We're Here!<br/>
We're Here! We're Here!"<br/>
<br/>
Even though letterboxers are stealthy and secretive by nature, we're<br/>
still a community.<br/>

&gt;&gt; What part of So. Cal. are you letterboxing in? I just joined today,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and all the posts from today (possibly yours excepted) seem to be from<br/>
&gt;&gt; the San Diego area. I'm in the San Gabriel Valley, about 20 miles east<br/>
&gt;&gt; of Los Angeles. Is anybody in the group from my area?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; Welcome! I'm a bit south of you, northeast of Long Beach. I think<br/>
&gt; you'll find plenty of people in your area. Vienna has been very<br/>
&gt; actively planting boxes in that area lately. And I don't know if<br/>
&gt; Buzzard is around anymore, but check out any of his boxes that are<br/>
&gt; still active in that area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just when I'd thought this list had fizzled out, we've had as much<br/>
&gt; activity in the last few weeks as in the previous several months.<br/>
&gt; Nice to see faces new and old poking out. I'm guessing we have a lot<br/>
&gt; of people who just lurk without posting, just checking in once in a<br/>
&gt; while to see if anything new is here. I'm guilty of that.<br/>
