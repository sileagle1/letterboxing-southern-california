Welcome Hansenclan.<br>
We are in the very Northern reaches of SoCal. Kernville is where we <br>
hang our hat 80% of the time. The balances is split between Seal <br>
Beach and on the road.<br>
I think you will find there are letterboxers spread out through the <br>
general LA area, a cluster in Orange Co. and several in San Diego.<br>

Welcome Hansenclan.<br>
We are in the very Northern reaches of SoCal. Kernville is where we <br>
hang our hat 80% of the time. The balances is split between Seal <br>
Beach and on the road.<br>
I think you will find there are letterboxers spread out through the <br>

Welcome!  I'm a bit south of you, northeast of Long Beach.  I think<br>
you'll find plenty of people in your area.  Vienna has been very<br>
actively planting boxes in that area lately.  And I don't know if<br>
Buzzard is around anymore, but check out any of his boxes that are<br>
still active in that area.<br>
<br>
Just when I'd thought this list had fizzled out, we've had as much<br>
activity in the last few weeks as in the previous several months. <br>
Nice to see faces new and old poking out.  I'm guessing we have a lot<br>
of people who just lurk without posting, just checking in once in a<br>
while to see if anything new is here.  I'm guilty of that.<br>
<br>
So if you popped in today and read this post, don't just breeze by:<br>
reply!  Like the Who's only Horton could hear, just post "We're Here!<br>
We're Here! We're Here!"<br>
<br>
Even though letterboxers are stealthy and secretive by nature, we're<br>
still a community.<br>
