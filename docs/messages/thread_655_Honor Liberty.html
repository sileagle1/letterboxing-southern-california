LbNA chatlist. It was pretty dissappointing to say the least. I'm <br/>
want to see if there is any real interest in setting her free in <br/>
SoCal.<br/>
<br/>
Now for those that may not be aware of what I'm writing about you <br/>
could go to the main LbNA list and search out for message #s listed <br/>
in my last post on the main list.<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell it is a HHer that gets her current (new) location <br/>
posted on where she is left not where she has been. It was released <br/>
first on 9-11-2002 and has a 9-11-01 theme. It has it's own container <br/>
and is currently on it's second logbook.<br/>
<br/>
If we get a good response on this list then I'll send her to someone. <br/>
If we don't then maybe retirement might be in order.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if anyone wants to keep her bouncing around in SoCal.<br/>
