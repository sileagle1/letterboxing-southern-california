LOL, boy that did NOT sound right on my first reading.  Who knew <br>
letterboxing was such an aphrodesiac?<br>
<br>
I'm still here, too.  Was quite pleasantly surprised to see so many new <br>
posts here all of a sudden.  Take A Hike and I have very tentatively <br>
talked about planning another gathering.  I'm way too busy at work <br>
right now for it to be any sooner than next spring, but the ideas are <br>
germinating nevertheless.<br>

Color me jealous!  Not that I can complain much.  I couldn't go because <br>
my vacation money and time for the year (or more) were spent on the <br>
Letterboxing Cruise, which was just fantastic!  If anyone is thinking <br>
about going on the next one... do!  Rumor has it that Mark & Sue are <br>
looking into the possibility of an Alaskan cruise.  I'm excited about <br>
it already-- as evidenced by the fact that I had a dream about it a few <br>
days ago!  And with it being on our end of the continent (well, kinda), <br>
I'm hoping more west coasters will come this time.  I felt a bit like <br>
the odd (wo)man out, though Ryan & Amanda and Grumpy Grinch were there <br>
also, and the east-coasters made me feel right at home.<br>

Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!  Whoops.  It didn't even cross my mind, because the <br>
kids and I usually box without Daddy...  Except for those Kern trips, <br>
then it's all of us and our two shepherds!<br>
