<br>
As many of you are aware I'm the Moderator here and about all I have <br>
to do is okay the new folks.<br>
 California Bear (SoCal chatlist owner) checks in once in a while, <br>
but doesn't seem to be all that active. Ryan is way too busy with AQ <br>
to keep up with the moderation. So unfortunately or fortunately that <br>
leaves me.<br>
<br>
I don't set up any "Topic of the Week/Month", but I do consider this <br>
YOUR chatlist. <br>
<br>
We do have several new folks that are lurking and even a few older <br>
letterboxers (boy I dislike that term) that have their messages <br>
bouncing and may not be active in Letterboxing.<br>
<br>
So with the concept of this being your list...chat away.If anyone <br>
wants to pose a topic/question please do.<br>

November, should anyone want to get together before all the holiday <br>

Since we have never searched for it before, we can't guarantee <br>
anything.  But this seems like a challenge we have to attempt.  We will <br>
report back later, much later.<br>

Don - as for the Big Catch box in San Diego, Maul and I were the last<br>

We eventually just combed the rocky area, being aware of the many<br>

<br>
Maul, Atlas the letterboxing dog, and I are up in Los Angeles and<br>
would LOVE a gathering.  For a while, I didn't think that people in<br>
SoCal would be into that sort of thing because it never seems to go on<br>
down here (though an occasional boxer has stumbled onto our yard sales<br>
with much success).  <br>

Hi BT<br>
<br>
There is a long time between when you found "Big Catch" and when we <br>
received the note about a "New Letterboxer" not being able to find <br>
the letterbox. Just because no one posted a note or logged their find <br>
online that doesn't mean that there weren't many other attempts or <br>
finders during that period of time.<br>
Hopefully the Grinches (or maybe a SD letterboxer) can ascertain if <br>
that box is viable.<br>
<br>
It very well could still be in place?<br>
<br>

GrumpyGrinch, I'd love to meet up with you guys when you're back in the <br>

Glad to see all the names (familiar and new) popping up!<br>

If you go to the clue sheet you will see what the last "attempter" did. <br>
So if you find a ziploc with some paper in it please remove.<br>

I still have a feeling that it is in the area, but not quite at the <br>
right spot.<br>

Wow!  I lit a match and started a forest fire!<br>
<br>
Thank you, Lee, for your recent plants, as my options locally are<br>
running thin.  In terms of box design and stamp design, "Birdhouse<br>
Blues" is one of the best ever.<br>
<br>
Yes, another gathering next Spring would be great.  I've never been<br>
involved in planning such a thing, but I'd be willing to help out.  If<br>
nothing else, I'd love to plant a series for a gathering.  Any<br>
suggestions on where or when?<br>

I was originally thinking of Irvine Regional Park, which has lots of <br>
hiking trails, as well as a small zoo, paddle boats and other neat <br>
stuff.  But I've found they charge quite a stiff fee to use one of <br>
their few group areas.  O'Neill Regional Park, on the other hand, also <br>
has lots of hiking trails, *and* lots of group areas that appear to be <br>
free to whoever gets there first.  They also have camping areas if <br>
anyone wanted to stay there.  The only problem I can see with O'Neill <br>
is that they close their trails for a few days after rainfall, which <br>
could be a problem, especially in the spring.<br>
<br>

Both Craig and Carbon Canyon would be nice, but O'Neill looks really<br>
nice, with lots of area to cover, and a bit more rustic.  The lack of<br>
cost, of course, would also seem to be a good point.<br>

Make that once every long while...  Like not reading this post till 2 <br>
months later.  I've been super busy going to school and raising a <br>
family.  I just took a look at letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com <br>
and noticed that there are quite a few boxes in the area.  I grabbed <br>
(or rather stamped) a couple of them yesterday:  Rock, Scissors, <br>
Paper and Cerdo Latino.  It's good to be back in the game...at least <br>
till next semester starts.<br>
