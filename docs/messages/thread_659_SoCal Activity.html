<br/>
As many of you are aware I'm the Moderator here and about all I have <br/>
to do is okay the new folks.<br/>
 California Bear (SoCal chatlist owner) checks in once in a while, <br/>
but doesn't seem to be all that active. Ryan is way too busy with AQ <br/>
to keep up with the moderation. So unfortunately or fortunately that <br/>
leaves me.<br/>
<br/>
I don't set up any "Topic of the Week/Month", but I do consider this <br/>
YOUR chatlist. <br/>
<br/>
We do have several new folks that are lurking and even a few older <br/>
letterboxers (boy I dislike that term) that have their messages <br/>
bouncing and may not be active in Letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
So with the concept of this being your list...chat away.If anyone <br/>
wants to pose a topic/question please do.<br/>
<br/>
Gwen &amp; I would love to come into the big city for another gathering.<br/>

Since we have never searched for it before, we can't guarantee <br/>
anything.  But this seems like a challenge we have to attempt.  We will <br/>
report back later, much later.<br/>

Don - as for the Big Catch box in San Diego, Maul and I were the last<br/>

We eventually just combed the rocky area, being aware of the many<br/>

Maul, Atlas the letterboxing dog, and I are up in Los Angeles and<br/>
would LOVE a gathering.  For a while, I didn't think that people in<br/>
SoCal would be into that sort of thing because it never seems to go on<br/>
down here (though an occasional boxer has stumbled onto our yard sales<br/>
with much success).  <br/>

Hi BT<br/>
<br/>
There is a long time between when you found "Big Catch" and when we <br/>
received the note about a "New Letterboxer" not being able to find <br/>
the letterbox. Just because no one posted a note or logged their find <br/>
online that doesn't mean that there weren't many other attempts or <br/>
finders during that period of time.<br/>
Hopefully the Grinches (or maybe a SD letterboxer) can ascertain if <br/>
that box is viable.<br/>
<br/>
It very well could still be in place?<br/>
<br/>

If you go to the clue sheet you will see what the last "attempter" did. <br/>
So if you find a ziploc with some paper in it please remove.<br/>
<br/>
I still have a feeling that it is in the area, but not quite at the <br/>
right spot.<br/>

it sounds like you have all the volunteers you need for this one.  I <br/>
plan to add a box to Ron and Kristal's Who's Hoo series, and search <br/>
for a couple boxes - whatever I can squeeze in.  Only one of their <br/>

haven't done much boxing lately, just a couple here and there.  I <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi BT<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There is a long time between when you found "Big Catch" and when <br/>
we <br/>
&gt; &gt; received the note about a "New Letterboxer" not being able to <br/>
find <br/>
&gt; &gt; the letterbox. Just because no one posted a note or logged their <br/>
&gt; find <br/>
&gt; &gt; online that doesn't mean that there weren't many other attempts <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; &gt; finders during that period of time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hopefully the Grinches (or maybe a SD letterboxer) can ascertain <br/>
if <br/>
&gt; &gt; that box is viable.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It very well could still be in place?<br/>

I was originally thinking of Irvine Regional Park, which has lots of <br/>
hiking trails, as well as a small zoo, paddle boats and other neat <br/>
stuff.  But I've found they charge quite a stiff fee to use one of <br/>
their few group areas.  O'Neill Regional Park, on the other hand, also <br/>
has lots of hiking trails, *and* lots of group areas that appear to be <br/>
free to whoever gets there first.  They also have camping areas if <br/>
anyone wanted to stay there.  The only problem I can see with O'Neill <br/>
is that they close their trails for a few days after rainfall, which <br/>
could be a problem, especially in the spring.<br/>

guess I wasn't involved in doing the research, since I don't know if <br/>
you reserve a spot or get there early to stake one out.<br/>

The last time we went to Carbon Canyon park (14-15 years ago), we <br/>

friend (now my husband) came stumbling back out of the beginning of <br/>
the trail, pushing me to safety:  he'd just seen a young rattlesnake <br/>
sunning itself on the trail!<br/>

&gt; has lots of hiking trails, *and* lots of group areas that appear to be <br/>
&gt; free to whoever gets there first.  They also have camping areas if <br/>
&gt; anyone wanted to stay there.  The only problem I can see with O'Neill <br/>
&gt; is that they close their trails for a few days after rainfall, which <br/>
&gt; could be a problem, especially in the spring.<br/>
<br/>
Both Craig and Carbon Canyon would be nice, but O'Neill looks really<br/>
nice, with lots of area to cover, and a bit more rustic.  The lack of<br/>
cost, of course, would also seem to be a good point.<br/>

till next semester starts.<br/>
