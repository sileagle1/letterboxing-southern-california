                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's been a few years since I was walking in the area, but there's a<br>
park north of Brookside on the other side of the freeway, Oak Grove<br>
Park, near the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  There was a frisbee golf<br>
course there.  I think there would be enough room and probably not<br>
tons of people.  It's an Oak grove, so not much in the way of<br>
manicured lawns.  There's also a nice shady trail that starts at the<br>
large east parking lot of the Lab and heads north into the Hahamongna<br>
Watershed Park.  The parking lot should be open on weekends.  The<br>
major drawback is that you would need to drive to Brookside, or the<br>
watershed trail from Oak Grove Park, if you wanted to spread out the<br>
boxes. Descanso Gardens is pretty close.  Maybe even the Eaton Canyon<br>
boxes would be do-able.<br>
