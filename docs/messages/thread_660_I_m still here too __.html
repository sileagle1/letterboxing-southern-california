I'm sad to say that I've kinda fallen off the letterboxing wagon in the past couple of years.I just got married and bought a homewhich took up most of my free time during that period. We did try to find one of the Haleakala boxes in Maui when we were there for our honeymoon last month, but sadly we came up empty. Letterboxing actually played a role in my marriage, believe it or not. I hadn't seen my husband since we'd dated in college, so the first time I drove down to San Diego to meet up I brought some clues and my letterboxing gear in case he turned out to be a dud, I could make the best of my day there. We ended up finding the boxes together thatday. It meant a lot that he was willing to give this odd, previously unheard of hobby a try. So we letterboxed on our first date :)<br>
Now to get him to carve his own stamp.... <br>

Nice to know you're still out there.  I really enjoyed the few plants<br>
of yours that I've found.  Still sad that the stamp was missing in<br>
"Barbara's Box"<br>
