to speak!  <br/>

We now have a new trail name for the whole family.  It's Holleys<br/>
Follies.  We decided to go with just one because it's often just too<br/>
hard too handle the dog and try to get three of us stamped in.  <br/>
<br/>
We stopped letterboxing for about a year when DD started playing<br/>
softball in spring of 07.  She's done with that and now we have<br/>
started up again.  Have been enjoying lots of Kelsung's boxes and of<br/>
course, Don and Gwen's in the last couple of weeks.<br/>
