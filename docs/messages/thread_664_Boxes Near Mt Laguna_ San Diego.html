<br>
My family is going camping next weekend to Burnt Rancheria Campground<br>
near Mt Laguna.  Can anyone recommend any boxes for us near there?  I<br>
found one "Rising From the Ashes" and "Stonewall Peeker" in Descanso<br>
and "Pacific Crest Trail" in Morena.  Then there are the several boxes<br>
in Julian.  These 3 places seem a little far from where we are<br>
staying. Are there any closer ones that I'm not seeing on Atlas Quest<br>
or LBNA?  <br>
<br>
Thanks!!<br>

Hi All, <br>
<br>
My family is going camping next weekend to Burnt Rancheria Campground<br>
near Mt Laguna. Can anyone recommend any boxes for us near there? I<br>
found one "Rising From the Ashes" and "Stonewall Peeker" in Descanso<br>
and "Pacific Crest Trail" in Morena. Then there are the several boxes<br>
in Julian. These 3 places seem a little far from where we are<br>
staying. Are there any closer ones that I'm not seeing on Atlas Quest<br>
or LBNA? <br>
<br>
Thanks!!<br>

I think the Grumpy Grinches have a few in that area as well. The <br>

search "nearby boxes" on AQ you will find several in Ramona as well.<br>
