<br/>
Maulë had posted on the AQ message boards and I wanted to notify y'all<br/>
as well.  She'll be running in the Long Beach Marathon on Sunday<br/>
October 12th.  We'll be down on Saturday to register her and then do<br/>
some boxing in the area.  On the big day of the race you should come<br/>
out, support a fellow boxer, do some exchanges, meet Atlas the<br/>
Letterboxing dog!  It should be pretty great.<br/>
<br/>
This is Maulë's first run with her new group, Train4Autism<br/>
(train4autism.org).  T4A allows athletes to raise money by<br/>
participating in athletic competitions and then alocate the money<br/>
raised to whichever charitie(s) they choose.  It was started by a very<br/>
close friend of ours, Brian Thompson, at the beginning of this year<br/>
and is already seeing great success.  <br/>
<br/>
So let us know if you'll be there, if you're running or if you want to<br/>
meet up!  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
