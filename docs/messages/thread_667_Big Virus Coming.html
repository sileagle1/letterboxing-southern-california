BIG VIRUS COMING !!! PLEASE READ &amp; FORWARD !!!<br/>

<br/>
Hi All, I checked with Norton Anti-Virus, and they are gearing up for this<br/>
virus! This is the worst virus announced by CNN.<br/>
I checked Snopes (URL above:), and it is for real!! Get this E-mail message<br/>
sent around to your contacts ASAP PLEASE FORWARD THIS WARNING AMONG<br/>
FRIENDS, FAMILY AND CONTACTS!<br/>
You should be alert during the next few days. Do not open any message with<br/>
an attachment entitled 'POSTCARD FROM HALLMARK,' regardless of who sent it<br/>
to you. It is a virus which opens A POSTCARD IMAGE, whichm 'burns' the<br/>
whole hard disc of your computer. This virus will be received from<br/>
someone who has your e-mail address in his/her contact list. This is the<br/>
reason why you need to send this e-mail to all your contacts. It is better<br/>
to receive this message 25 times than to receive the virus and open it. <br/>
<br/>
If you receive a mail called' POSTCARD,' even though sent to you by a<br/>
friend, do not open it!&lt; BR&gt;Shut down your computer immediately.<br/>
<br/>
It has been classified by Microsoft as the most destructive virus ever. This<br/>
virus was discovered by McAfee yesterday, and there is no repair yet for<br/>
this kind of virus. This virus simply destroys the Zero Sector of the Hard<br/>
Disc, where the vital information is kept.<br/>
<br/>
COPY THIS E-MAIL AND SEND IT TO YOUR FRIENDS. REMEMBER: IF YOU SEND IT TO<br/>
THEM, YOU WILL BENEFIT ALL OF US. <br/>
<br/>
Snopes lists all the names it could come in.<br/>

Have you actually READ this snopes.com article?  It states that,<br/>
although a virus is real, this very email is a HOAX.  Simply opening<br/>
an email will NEVER give you a virus.  Clicking on a link WITHIN the<br/>
email will.<br/>
<br/>
If you're not sure if something is true, find out first before simply<br/>
forwarding ever SPAM that comes your way.  This is the cholesterol<br/>
that clogs the arteries of the internet.<br/>

&gt; Have you actually READ this snopes.com article?<br/>
<br/>
Ever wondered who the heck is Snopes?<br/>
<br/>
Well check out the Wikipedia listing for Snopes. (Yes I realize that <br/>
Wikipedia could be just another web bs thing as Snopes)<br/>
<br/>
This might temper your thinking of Snopes being the answer for the <br/>
internet bs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  This is the cholesterol<br/>

<br/>
That hardly is the case for this chatlist. Not much to clog up here.<br/>
