                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay all you SoCal letterboxers, and Central CA. friends,<br/>
<br/>
This is it for a while; as I mentioned in a previous post, I promised <br/>
the French Hen to scale back on my letterboxing activities for now <br/>
and concentrate on the holidays.  So here's my holiday contribution <br/>
to letterboxing in SoCal.  I'll post this to the national sites in a <br/>
week.  Happy Halloween!!!!<br/>
<br/>
THE HALLOWEEN SERIES<br/>
<br/>
Placed by:  Buzzard<br/>
Placed on:  10/19/03<br/>
State:  California<br/>
County:  Los Angeles<br/>
Nearest City:  Pasadena<br/>
Number of boxes: 6<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  Easy.  Dogs on a leash are okay, as are children in <br/>
strollers.  Wheelchairs can get to some of these letterboxes, please <br/>
email me for details.<br/>
<br/>
We Pasadenans love holidays.  We put holiday-themed lights on our <br/>
houses, fly banners outside our houses, and decorate our lawns with <br/>
lighted figures for St. Patrick's Day, July 4th, Easter, Presidents' <br/>
Day, and, most of all to celebrate our favorite holidays:  Halloween <br/>
and Christmas.  As a true Pasadenan, I love all holidays, but my all-<br/>
time personal favorite is Halloween!  By October 7th, the French Hen <br/>
and I have decorated our house with Halloween lights, vintage die-<br/>
cuts, and special effects (black lights, fog machine, strobe light, <br/>
scary music, etc.).  On Halloween night, I've been known to don a <br/>
spooky costume and hide in bushes around the neighborhood in order to <br/>
jump out and scare trick-or-treaters.  <br/>
<br/>
As I introduce my Halloween letterbox series let me make this <br/>
perfectly clearI'm a believer in a scary Halloween.  You won't find <br/>
any smiling ghosts or cutesy benevolent witches in my Halloween <br/>
Seriesit's scary!  So if you letterbox with an impressionable, <br/>
possibly nightmare-prone child (or adult . . .), you may want to <br/>
reconsider tackling this series.  <br/>
<br/>
#1  Suicide Bridge<br/>
This beautiful 1,467 foot concrete bridge is the scenic gateway into <br/>
downtown Pasadena, just northeast of downtown Los Angeles. It is also <br/>
well-known to Angelenos as "Suicide Bridge."<br/>
<br/>
Constructed in 1913, the 150 ft. high structure crosses the dry <br/>
Arroyo Seco riverbed. A decades-old story maintains that the body of <br/>
a worker who toppled into a just-poured concrete support could not be <br/>
recovered and remains entombed in the bridge to this day.  <br/>
Supposedly, his soul cries out to other desparate beings.  While this <br/>
particular story is unfounded, a number of men did die awful deaths <br/>
in the bridge's construction.  This may explain why the bridge became <br/>
a hot spot of sorts during the early part of the last century and the <br/>
Depression when 95 people jumped to their deaths between 1919 and <br/>
1937.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most famous suicides occurred on May 1, 1937, when a <br/>
despondent mother threw her baby girl over the railing and then <br/>
jumped over herself. The mother died, but miraculously, the little <br/>
girl survived the plunge. Her mother had inadvertently tossed her <br/>
into some nearby trees, and she was later recovered from the thick <br/>
branches.<br/>
<br/>
Exit the 210 Freeway at Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena and drive <br/>
south to the corner of Colorado Boulevard and Orange Grove.  From <br/>
this point, travel one block south on Orange Grove to Green Street.  <br/>
Turn right on Green Street for one block, then right on Grand for one <br/>
block until you come to a circular dead end in a park area.  Park <br/>
your car where you are allowed (check the signs), and walk along the <br/>
paved path west toward the bridge.  On the bridge, you will see <br/>
regularly-spaced, inset benches.  Count them until you get to bench <br/>
number six on the bridge's south side; here, sit and rest, and notice <br/>
that you are at the one of the bridge's highest pointsthe place <br/>
where someone committing suicide would have likely climbed over the <br/>
railing.  In front of you, separating the sidewalk from the street, <br/>
are double metal guardrails mounted on evenly-spaced metal posts.  <br/>
Look beneath the lower rail behind the left-most post you see in <br/>
front of you for the letterbox.  <br/>

admittedly creepy, but we kept the creepiest details from the <br/>
smallest fry in our group, so Watermelon won't have nightmares.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a (ahem) sit-rep on the Halloween series:<br/>
<br/>
~Suicide Bridge--alive and well (pun intended) WARNING: despite <br/>
vigilance on our part and the fact that both girls watched me squat <br/>
down on the pedestrian side of the rail to retrieve the box, BOTH <br/>
girls managed to lean forward over the guard rail to look for where <br/>
it had been hidden, thereby putting their heads right out into <br/>
traffic. We had just chewed out the older one when the younger one <br/>
tried it.  Thank heavens there were no cars going by either time!  If <br/>
you take kids, be warned that this maneuver appears to be an <br/>
irresistible kid temptation, and traffic, when there is any, whizzes <br/>
by awfully close. Also, this is an isolated area with some old, <br/>
abandoned buildings at the east end of the bridge. There are homeless <br/>
folks in the area.  I was glad G String was with me and I wasn't <br/>
alone with the kids in the middle of the bridge when a large homeless <br/>
man shuffled by. (BTW, we got some odd looks for having kids on the <br/>
bridge in the first place.  Found the whole thing creepy--as <br/>
intended!)<br/>
<br/>
~Rialto Theater--didn't find the box. Don't know whether it is <br/>
missing, I was looking in the wrong spot, or whether someone else had <br/>
it and was stamping in. I felt I was drawing a lot of attention to <br/>
the spot, so we bailed . . .<br/>
<br/>
~Memorial Park Moon--alive and well. Had to dodge a pug rescue event <br/>
in the park, but managed this easily.<br/>
<br/>
~Memorial Park Scaredy Cat--alive and well and guarded by a squirrel<br/>
<br/>
~Charmed Witch--alive and well. Had to tiptoe through the KidSpace <br/>
Halloween festivities to get there because we walked over from <br/>
Memorial Park.<br/>
<br/>
~Halloween Ghost--didn't budget our time well and arrived about 7 <br/>
minutes too late to enter, so will have to visit Mr. Woodson next <br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Ours were the first stamps in the four boxes we found.<br/>
<br/>
This series was nicely done. Obviously a LOT of thought went into the <br/>
whole project.  The stamps were lovely and varied and related nicely <br/>
both to the theme and the locations.  (We particularly liked the Moon <br/>
stamp!) In all, 5 thumbs up!<br/>
<br/>
It was a nice, low exercise way to get away from the worst of the <br/>
smoke and ash.  Many thanks!<br/>

I mean, I like it, but . . . well, what do I know), Moody Cat, Watermelon, and Jelly Bean, Thank you so much for traveling out to find my series--the first finders!  In a couple of days, I will post the clues on letterboxing.org, and will include your cautions about the Pasadena bridge traffic.  The French Hen and I don't have children (we're civilians), and I've worried at times whether or not my letterboxes are kid-approved, and ask advice from letterboxing parents.  Those abandoned buildings east of the bridge are shortly going to be turned into expensive condomeniums; they do add a spooky touch now though.  I'm glad to hear that at least four of my boxes survived my initial planting.  I was particularly worried about the Charmed Witch and Memorial Park Moon letterboxes, because I don't think they are very well hidden.  But I'm going to be royally PISSED OFF if the Rialto Theater Letterbox is missing!  I thought that was a FANTASTIC hiding place--a letterbox that wouldn't be found in five years (and a nicely carved stamp too).  It would be unusual for a posse such as yours to be hanging out behind the Rialto Theater, so I can imagine you were drawing undo attention.  I'll try and check that box out tomorrow and let you know if it's really missing.  I think the last stamp in the series is the nicest, and I'm particularly proud of the clues, 'cos they are truly freaky, so I hope you get a chance to check it out next weekend (hopefully along with the Rialto Theater Stamp).  --Buzzard--- On Sun 10/26, Dawnette &lt; rbngdfello@aol.com &gt; wrote:From: Dawnette [mailto: rbngdfello@aol.com]To: letterboxing-socal@yahoogroups.comDate: Mon, 27 Oct 2003 03:47:00 -0000Subject: [letterboxing-socal] Re: New Letterbox Series in Southern California!We started this series today and had a blast.

I visited the Rialto Theater today, and am relieved to report that my <br/>
letterbox is still in place.  When you walk down the concrete incline <br/>
behind the theater, walk up to the bottom step of the metal stairs in <br/>
front of you. You are right, this letterbox is a magnetized box that <br/>
is stuck underneath the bottom step, at the front, right edge. This <br/>
step is so low you can't see the box, and if you reached underneath <br/>
and felt for it, you might think it's just part of the structure of <br/>
the stair step; like I said, great hiding place (as if anyone but a <br/>
crazy letterboxer is going to reach their hand underneath spider-<br/>
central).  So along with my Ghost Stamp in Sierra Madre, that makes <br/>
two new stamps for your clan to look for.<br/>
--Buzzard (G Sting is a guitar string--oooohh, of course; how could I <br/>
have missed that? I would think a great signature stamp of a guitar <br/>
could be made for that name, but I don't remember seeing one.)<br/>
