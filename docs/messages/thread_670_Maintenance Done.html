                    <div class="plaintext-content">You might want to consider setting up a trip to Kernville in the <br/>
Springtime. Figure on 3 very busy letterboxing days and that excludes <br/>
all of our high country boxes (the roads may not be open to those <br/>
until late May?) I think we have somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 <br/>
or so letterboxes in the area.<br/>
It is approximately 3 hours, 20 minutes, and 35 seconds from Seal <br/>
Beach without stopping to box, eat or whiz. <br/>
Right now it is great hiking weather but with the holidays everyone <br/>
is super busy.<br/>

Busy, yes, but the thought of all those little treasures in what I<br/>
imagine are a lot of beautiful locations is very tempting....<br/>
