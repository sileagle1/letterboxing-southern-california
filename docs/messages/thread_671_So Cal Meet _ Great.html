Sadly, I work both days.  Saturday is always a long day for me, but<br>
Sunday I only work Noon to 6:00, so if it was before or, better yet,<br>
after then I could make it.  So I'm suggesting a pizza DINNER instead<br>
of lunch.  Would that be too much to ask?<br>

ahh a meet and greet!  Since we're not heading back east these<br>
Holidays, either day would be fine for Maulë and I.  I've been off the<br>
radar for a bit, trying to launch a company and website and Maulë has<br>
been finishing up this semester.  Some letterboxing in our life is<br>
much needed.<br>
