prefer Speedy Stamp over Master Carve. Although the thickness<br/>
eliminates the need for a backing, it still has a little too much<br/>
crumble factor when doing the details. The only thing that holds up<br/>
better than the pink stuff is the orange stuff, but it's TOO hard and<br/>
slick, so doesn't hold ink very well for stamping.<br/>

Just had to express my two cents. It was frustrating that my "Venus"<br/>
turned out a lot better than I expected I could do, but I still lost a<br/>
nick in her shoulder.<br/>

Interesting how different carvers like different material. My first <br/>
choice is white PZKut grade A, second choice is PZKut white B and <br/>
thirdly  PZKut orange. I really dislike Master Carve and if I can <br/>
remember to bring the piece with me on the meet and greet then someone <br/>
can have it. Can that be a bribe for Sunday?????<br/>
<br/>
Getting Grade A white can be a problem as Stampeaz doesn't have it all <br/>
the time, and when they do have it, it doesn't stay around long.<br/>
<br/>
With any of the PZKuts you have to keep your nibs sharpened before and <br/>
during carving.<br/>
<br/>
The surface can be a problem with either one but using acetone scrubb <br/>
just prior to making a transfer of the image onto the carving medium <br/>
does more than help the transfer. It sets the surface up for a better <br/>
inking.<br/>
Another technique for fixing the surface is to use 600 wet or dry <br/>
sandpaper lightly on the stamps surface.<br/>
<br/>
I like to use the acetone BEFORE carving as if it is used after carving <br/>
it can screw up a stamp as the acetone actually eats into the rubber <br/>
material.<br/>

I've had a lot of problems with doing the transfer on both PZ CUT<br/>
orange and the pink stuff.  I used to whip up my designs in<br/>
illustrator, print them, xerox them and try the transfer, but it got<br/>
so frustrating that I started just freehanding the stamps.  My stamps<br/>
have certainly suffered!  I'll have to try the "acetone scrub," as you<br/>
call it (and the 600grit).<br/>
<br/>
I carved my signature stamp out of pzcut orange and i think it holds<br/>
the ink TOO well.  It's a total caked mess and it shows no signs of<br/>
being able to be cleaned.  I definately like the pink stuff the best.<br/>

Webfoot's (Stampeaz owner)carving kit is a super way to get to know <br/>
which medium you like best. That includes tools as well, Speedball, <br/>
Exacto, Staedler.<br/>
<br/>
You should get some of the "Pink Stuff" as well.<br/>
<br/>
The only carving medium that I wouldn't reccomend you getting is <br/>
Plumber's gasket. I've seen some folks try that stuf and it is <br/>
horrible.<br/>
<br/>
Different mediums should be tried. For those soft ones, placing it in <br/>
the frig can change it a bit also.<br/>
<br/>
Next time you want a cheese sandwich try carving some Kraft American <br/>
cheese squares.<br/>
