I must have done something wrong.  I wasn't notified about the Hermosa <br/>
Beach gathering via the search I had set up.<br/>
<br/>
Now... I KNOW about the gathering because of THIS group, and sadly, I <br/>
can't attend (working), but I'm wondering what I did wrong -- all it <br/>
will show me is letterboxes within a 50-mile radius of my home.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on setting one up, for the rare gatherings, instead?  <br/>
(I thought I'd done that, but apparently not -- or else it can't be <br/>
done.)<br/>

the AQ Help Board. Maybe another Mod or Administrator could help you. <br/>
Ryan changes so much stuff it is hard to stay up on all the bells and <br/>
whistles.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that you can set your preferences to be notified about <br/>
Event Boxes, but in this case there are no E boxes listed.<br/>
<br/>
With so many functions at AQ I tend to not use many of them as my <br/>
life seems a bit simplier. Thus I do not stay current to many <br/>
functions.<br/>
<br/>
One thing nice about this lists lack of posts is that when something <br/>
is going on in SoCal it does get posted and noticed here.<br/>
