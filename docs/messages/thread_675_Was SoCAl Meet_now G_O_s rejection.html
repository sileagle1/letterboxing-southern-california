Hey Brenda<br>
<br>
Everytime you post something it gets placed in the possible spam file <br>
on this list. In case you were wondering why you messages get delayed <br>
a bit. I think it has something to do with Blaster in the address. <br>
Geishagirls post also went there and that may be due to her tagging <br>
it on your message? I'm sure there is someway to fix it, but unless <br>
CA. Bear is lurking it won't get a fix.<br>
