&gt; &gt; Hey Brenda<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Everytime you post something it gets placed in the possible spam <br/>
&gt; file <br/>
&gt; &gt; on this list. In case you were wondering why you messages get <br/>
&gt; delayed <br/>
&gt; &gt; a bit. I think it has something to do with Blaster in the address. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Geishagirls post also went there and that may be due to her <br/>
tagging <br/>
&gt; &gt; it on your message? I'm sure there is someway to fix it, but <br/>
unless <br/>
&gt; &gt; CA. Bear is lurking it won't get a fix.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

My moderator skills are like my typing skills. Hunt and peck. I finally cruised around until I found the No Moderation switch.<br/>

Thanks Ca. Bear.<br/>
