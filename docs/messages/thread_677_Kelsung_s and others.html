Beach today. We found a total of 6 including Da Blimp in Carson.<br/>
The last one reminded Gwen of her Blimp ride a few years back ( I <br/>
stayed behind on that flight) <br/>
<br/>
All letterboxes were in great shape and completely dry. Even Hollies <br/>
Follies' stuck in a drain pipe was dry as a bone.<br/>
<br/>
It is great to come back into the area and have a bunch of boxes to <br/>
find. Thanks to all of the planters!<br/>
