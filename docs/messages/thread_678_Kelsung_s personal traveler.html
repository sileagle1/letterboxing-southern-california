I worried about that one when I found it.  I figured the first rain<br>
would ruin it.  Great to hear that it held up fine.  And I'm looking<br>
forward to meeting them Sunday.<br>
<br>
One of their earliest finds was my Word Association box, which I'm<br>
sure might have been frustrating for more experienced boxers like<br>
Tdyans and Gwen (you can't fool me, Don, I know she found it without you).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I just wanted to announce that I'll have a brand new personal<br>
traveler ready on Sunday.  I've enjoyed getting traveler stamps from<br>
several people at prior gatherings, so I figured it was time I made<br>
one myself.  Of course, those who've found my boxes will certainly<br>
guess I've added my own twist.<br>

BTW, on LbNA it's traveller, but on AQ it's traveler.  Spell check<br>
agrees with AQ, but Dictionary.com let me know that LbNA is just using<br>
the British spelling.  Appropriate, I suppose, considering our hobby's<br>
roots.<br>
