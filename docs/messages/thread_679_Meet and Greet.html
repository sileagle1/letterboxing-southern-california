You truly are insane.  I used to think you were just a little slow,<br/>
but now I'm convinced you're a total psycho.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I posted all six boxes on LbNA and AQ so you can log finds (cuz I love<br/>
getting feedback) but I won't post the actual clues till maybe the new<br/>
year, so all of you attendees have a chance to get at them first.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and after a conversation with Don &amp; Gwen about trouble they've had<br/>
with the keepers of the Marsh Preserve in the past, I'm not going to<br/>
use it's formal name in the title or the clues, thus preventing it<br/>
from coming up in a google search.  But it's a nice little spot, so I<br/>
encourage everyone to check it out.  I met a couple bird-watchers<br/>
while on my way to plant it.<br/>
<br/>
It was such a great time to see so many new faces that I could put to<br/>
trail names, as well as see again some old faces that have become more<br/>
and more familiar.<br/>

Sorry, GeoG,  looks like I missed both of you.  The "Dream Lover" box you dedicated to FT <br/>
was very moving and I'm proud to have been first finder on both of your boxes. <br/>
Your spelling may be a bit unique but you do know how to carve a stamp! =-D<br/>

                    <html><body> I would be available for the 13th, but probably not a Monday evening meet and greet (live too far out for a meet and greet.on a work night).  I don't know about Long Beach parks, but checked out the Tri-City regional in Placentia - not bad large park with open spaces, some decent hiding spots.  I liked your Bunny theme, since its almost Easter.  I would need help planting some boxes, since its less than 2 weeks away. and someone to do an event stamp.  Maybe afternoon, and not mess with food.
