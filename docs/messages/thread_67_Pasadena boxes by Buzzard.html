Better hurry Buzzard!  By next week I'll be back in action!!!! ; )<br>

Work is the agonizing experience that comes before retirement.  Retirement <br>
is the time of your life when you can devote all of your time to the <br>
pursuit of all the hobbies you couldn't do because of work.<br>
<br>
BTW: Are there any boxes in the areas that are currently being crisped?  <br>
That has always been something I have worried about:  having one of my <br>
boxes (or more particularly, my stamp) go up in smoke because of a brush <br>
fire.  Does anyone know if this has ever happened to a box?<br>

It was quite a relief to be the first stamp in the Lacy Park <br>
Letterbox, which is planted in my own back yard.  It took me a couple <br>
of weeks before I was able to get to the park (a delay not of my own <br>
making), and during the whole time I was afraid that when I found the <br>
letterbox, your beautifully-carved stamp would be in my own <br>
neighborhood's box ahead of me.  <br>

That's an amazing story about your own house being nearly ingulfed by <br>
a fire--that is so scary.  Our house was not as threatened as yours, <br>
but a great early 90's fire in our local San Gabriel Mountains did <br>
destroy homes five blocks away from us, and did devastate Eaton <br>
Canyon, where some of my letterboxes are now hidden (not hidden at <br>
the time of the fire).  Wildfires are part of the price we pay for <br>
living in these beautiful areas.  There are no wildfires in downtown  <br>
Los Angeles, which is far from the rugged, beautiful mountains.<br>

After Nov.5 we will have the two missing letterboxes back in action in the Seal Beach Tour. FYI the stamps are new and improved. One is totally different,and we are counting them as already placed but those that had the other image could count it as a new F.<br>

  California Bear (Eric),It gave me an incredible high to finally, after a whole day sitting before plaques, find I was the 1st stamp in the "Fish In The Reads," one of Don &amp; Gwen Seal Beach Tour letterboxes.  You and Jam &amp; Jelly had been to all others before me.  I know we'd all agree that it is an honor to be one of the firsts in any of Don &amp; Gwen's great letterboxes.--Buzzard --- On Fri 10/24, California Bear &lt; californiabear@comcast.net &gt; wrote:From: California Bear [mailto: californiabear@comcast.net]To: letterboxing-socal@yahoogroups.comDate: Fri, 24 Oct 2003 12:00:31 -0700Subject: Re: [letterboxing-socal] Re: Pasadena boxes by BuzzardI helps to live in the Long Beach area and to drive past these boxes every day on your to and from work.  ; )  ----- Original Message -----   From: trentlaudes   Subject: [letterboxing-socal] Re: Pasadena boxes by Buzzard  California Bear (who usually   beats me out to your Long Beach/Seal Beach stamps...grrr) was there,   along with some new SoCal letterboxers, and old Central Coast and   San Francisco letterboxers with high PF counts.[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] <br>
