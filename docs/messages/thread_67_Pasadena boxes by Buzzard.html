It was quite a relief to be the first stamp in the Lacy Park <br/>
Letterbox, which is planted in my own back yard.  It took me a couple <br/>
of weeks before I was able to get to the park (a delay not of my own <br/>
making), and during the whole time I was afraid that when I found the <br/>
letterbox, your beautifully-carved stamp would be in my own <br/>
neighborhood's box ahead of me.  <br/>

That's an amazing story about your own house being nearly ingulfed by <br/>
a fire--that is so scary.  Our house was not as threatened as yours, <br/>
but a great early 90's fire in our local San Gabriel Mountains did <br/>
destroy homes five blocks away from us, and did devastate Eaton <br/>
Canyon, where some of my letterboxes are now hidden (not hidden at <br/>
the time of the fire).  Wildfires are part of the price we pay for <br/>
living in these beautiful areas.  There are no wildfires in downtown  <br/>
Los Angeles, which is far from the rugged, beautiful mountains.<br/>
