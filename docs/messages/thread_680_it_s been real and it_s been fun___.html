I wanted to express to everyone I met today how amiable and warm<br>

I thank everyone for that.  <br>

I'm wondering if anyone noticed a weird stamp in their logbook... it<br>
was, if I may be crass and to the point, a giant ass.  Did anyone see<br>
a giant ass at the gathering today?  <br>

That giant ass was the first to post today about the meet and greet. <br>
Read her AQ profile and you should get an idea of how far her brain is<br>
from reality.  And if you dig way back in the archives to around<br>
March, 2005 (both here and on the main chatlist) you may learn the<br>
story of how the madness began, a few months before I discovered<br>
letterboxing.  I wish I'd been around then.<br>

I believe I may have the same ass in my logbook.  It showed up on a <br>
page that I had used early on in the meet but I don't remember seeing <br>
it there till after the meet.  Does it have any letters around it?<br>

Really Kelsung! You shouldn't be so hard on the poor girl! You know <br>
she can't help it! Plus, you know she reads these boards, so I really <br>
hope she doesn't take anything you say too personally!! Eesh! I did <br>
see her pop in at the event, but it looks like she left before I even <br>
had a chance to give her some LBing tips.  I don't even seem to <br>
recall what she was wearing! We can tell her next time that it's not <br>
customary to grab people's logbooks at random and stamp in them at <br>
her leisure... =)<br>
<br>
It was great seeing everyone again and also making new LBing friends! <br>
Thanks Piper Paws for getting us all together! Good pizza, great <br>
people, awesome day! I hope it won't be another year before we meet <br>
again!<br>
<br>
Happy Holidays everyone!<br>
