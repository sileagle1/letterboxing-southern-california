differently I imagine various boxers track their numbers.  Obviously,<br>
it's an informal thing, and some don't bother to keep track at all,<br>

noticed by now) so I was curious what other people's thoughts were.<br>

P 55<br>
This includes all my traditionals, hitchhikers, and now a personal<br>
traveler.<br>
F 411<br>
This includes traditionals and personal travelers.  My logic is that<br>
in most cases I had to figure out some kind of clue to get the<br>
traveler, I just had to find the person, not a box location.<br>
X 74<br>
This is the one number I'm not confident is accurate.  For example: I<br>
have "Don and Gwen's" big stamp, but I also have both Don's fat duck<br>
hunter and Gwen's penguin, as well as Maggie the Dog.  So is this one<br>
exchange, two (for two people) or four (four total stamps)?  Also, I<br>
just got new stamps from Chokato, LilRainDrop and Gerwaiian Oma (but<br>
not Tdyans, darn it!) but I have their old ones.  I wouldn't count<br>
that as a new exchange, but I suppose some might (it is, after all, a<br>
new stamp image I've collected).<br>
HH 25<br>
This includes all hitchhikers I've found.  I don't include these in my<br>
P count, because I stumbled on them as a bonus, rather than seeking<br>
them out via clues.<br>
EV 16<br>
This includes all event stamps, including the several traveling ones I<br>
got at the Huntington Beach gathering, and cooties as well, since I'm<br>
only ever going to get one of those at an event, and it seemed silly<br>
to keep a separate count for such a small part of the overall hobby.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any counter-logic as to how they would total theirs<br>
differently?<br>
<br>
The last gathering put me over the 200 mark, and thanks to PBandJ's<br>
travelers (I got 17 out of 23!) this gathering put me over the 400<br>
mark.  Still a far cry from the 10,000+ Wanda and Pete have.  I'm<br>
jealous of retirees.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well Grasshopper the first thing you have to do is reduce your <br>
personality type from AAA down to a single A. Once you do that then <br>
you will give up your obsessiveness about counting anything other <br>
than how much $ you have to spend. Retirement is not all a bed of <br>
roses. Just think how we feel everytime I look at where the S&P is <br>
these days.<br>
Now since you were mentioning Pete and Wanda, their last count was <br>
something over 13000, so why bother?<br>
<br>
Now you have a idea why we don't bother to count anymore. We just <br>
enjoy the process and that is one of the real beauties of <br>
Letterboxing.  Mark Pepe came up with the best analogy that <br>
letterboxing is like an onion, some folks peel back several layers, <br>
and others just find that layer that they are comfortable with. The <br>
real joy for Gwen and Don is the folks.<br>
<br>
It was great seeing all of the new/old faces, and Kudos to Piper Paws <br>
for a great Holiday get-to-gether.<br>
<br>
Merry Christmas to all!!!!!<br>
