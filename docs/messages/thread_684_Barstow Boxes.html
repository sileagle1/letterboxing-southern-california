If you're just passing through Barstow and looking for a quick driveby, <br/>
My Hero has been replanted.  Thanks, Lee, for reminding me to finally <br/>
do that.<br/>
<br/>
If you want a bit of a longer letterbox search, I've just posted the <br/>
clues for a new box, Desert Tortoise.  I wasn't trying for it, but I <br/>
just barely missed out being the 45,000th box on LbNA!  If you go after <br/>
this one, stop at Plata's on the way there or back for some yummy <br/>
Mexican food.  That and a retired postal stamp might make it worth the <br/>
trip into the middle of nowhere. ;)<br/>

&gt; Wow, and it seems like only yesterday that Kelsung's "Yellow Flower"<br/>
box was the 20,000th  <br/>
&gt; box on LBNA! (Actually it was Jan 2006.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And still going strong.  That one and my Sleeping Dragon are the only<br/>
two of my original plants that have never been damaged or come up<br/>
missing (I planted 16 boxes Jan-Mar, 2006), and for their third<br/>
anniversary they'll be getting new logbooks since the old ones are full.<br/>
<br/>
That seems so long ago to me, but to the silverbacks I'm sure I seem<br/>
like a relatively new planter.<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of new plants, PeterK just swept through today and picked<br/>
up nine of my plants from December.  But that SST Records clue is<br/>
driving him crazy.  He's sent me three emails already asking for<br/>
hints.  <wicked grin=""><br/>
