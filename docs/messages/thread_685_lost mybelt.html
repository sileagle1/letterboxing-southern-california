your belt, not your mind...<br>

well i went letter boxing at the college in long beach and only found <br>
two boxes then i headed to ward down town long beach and stopped for a <br>
bud<br>
<br>
i looked at where i stopped but they didnt see my New Green Belt<br>
<br>
my car conked out on 7th street & one street past ximeno and i walked <br>
along where the redcar used to go (grammy told me so a long time ago)<br>
i do remember siting down near a telephone poal and having a smoke there<br>
<br>
<br>
 then i got my car started and went to the pizza paloure<br>
<br>
I went to the bathroum at the pizza parloure but i don't know if my <br>
belt was on or not<br>
<br>
maybe i should quit drinking so much bud<br>

If you were drinking and driving at noon, it sounds to me like you may<br>
have a problem.  Have you considered AA, GG?<br>

Sometimes it's the solution and not the problem.  Besides, noon is<br>
when you are allowed to start drinking.  She never said the car was<br>
moving at the time so it's unfair to assume she was driving.<br>

She said she had "a 6 pack, maybe two" then she got her car to start<br>
and came to the pizza parlor.  That sounds to me like someone who<br>
needs a 12 step program.  I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just being<br>
concerned for her safety.  :)<br>

I don't live too far from that area... I can take another look.<br>
You said you broke down around 7th & where the red cars used to run?  <br>
Do you happen to recall if you walked North towards the pier, or <br>
south?<br>
