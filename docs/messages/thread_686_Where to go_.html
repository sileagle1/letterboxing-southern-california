                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of my few jaunts to that area, one of my favorites was the South<br>
Pasadena Series.  Some of them are missing, but #4 would be cool for<br>
kids (if they can be discreet) and even if #5 is missing, the location<br>
would be fun.<br>
<br>

<br>
Sadly, the Hahamongna Series appear to be mostly missing, because<br>
those would be great for kids.<br>
<br>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=22182<br>
<br>
Further beyond those in that same park you would also find #11 in The<br>
Halloween Series, but I would NOT recommend that one for kids.<br>
<br>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=6223<br>
<br>
There are some longer hikes in that area that I just haven't gotten to<br>
yet, like Millard Falls or Coooper Canyon, but I will eventually.<br>

<br>
We haven't explored as far as Pasadena yet, but if you do an Arcadia <br>
search, you'll find a couple of letterboxes in the L.A. County <br>
Arboraetum.  I plan on introducing a friend and her tribe of 4 kids to <br>
letterboxing at the Arboraetum tomorrow, so I'll let you know how it <br>
goes.  We tried to find one of the boxes there, a year ago, without <br>
success, and I was too "green" to have planned ahead and brought a <br>
second set of clues along.  Even without the success of a find, we had <br>
a wonderful day (I have 2 elementary kids, myself) there.  We'll be <br>
trying that one box again, I think -- since others have found it after <br>
me.  (Will have to doublecheck on that.)<br>
<br>
So glad you'll get to head out this way and visit your kids!<br>
<br>
Blessings,<br>

If you happen to go to Millard Falls letterbox you may want to do a <br>
little research on the main LbNA chatlist before going.<br>
<br>
There was a little controversy regarding this letterbox and that is <br>
the reason I posted the note at the end of the clues.<br>
<br>
The message on the main list is called "Pandora's Rant", message <br>
number 27677, dated 6/4/2003. You can pull up this message by typing <br>
in the number in the search function on the messages page. Once read <br>
then my note may make more sense.<br>

I actually ended up in Lake Elsinore for New Year's Eve, so I spent<br>
New Year's Day hunting Katpau's SRP boxes.  Wonderful hikes to missing<br>
boxes, although one had been replaced by another boxer.  I had a great<br>
day.  But I'll be heading to Millard Falls soon.<br>
