                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of my few jaunts to that area, one of my favorites was the South<br/>
Pasadena Series.  Some of them are missing, but #4 would be cool for<br/>
kids (if they can be discreet) and even if #5 is missing, the location<br/>
would be fun.<br/>
<br/>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=7104<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, the Hahamongna Series appear to be mostly missing, because<br/>
those would be great for kids.<br/>
<br/>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=22182<br/>
<br/>
Further beyond those in that same park you would also find #11 in The<br/>
Halloween Series, but I would NOT recommend that one for kids.<br/>
<br/>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=6223<br/>
<br/>
There are some longer hikes in that area that I just haven't gotten to<br/>
yet, like Millard Falls or Coooper Canyon, but I will eventually.<br/>

<br/>
We haven't explored as far as Pasadena yet, but if you do an Arcadia <br/>
search, you'll find a couple of letterboxes in the L.A. County <br/>
Arboraetum.  I plan on introducing a friend and her tribe of 4 kids to <br/>
letterboxing at the Arboraetum tomorrow, so I'll let you know how it <br/>
goes.  We tried to find one of the boxes there, a year ago, without <br/>
success, and I was too "green" to have planned ahead and brought a <br/>
second set of clues along.  Even without the success of a find, we had <br/>
a wonderful day (I have 2 elementary kids, myself) there.  We'll be <br/>
trying that one box again, I think -- since others have found it after <br/>
me.  (Will have to doublecheck on that.)<br/>
<br/>
So glad you'll get to head out this way and visit your kids!<br/>

If you happen to go to Millard Falls letterbox you may want to do a <br/>
little research on the main LbNA chatlist before going.<br/>
<br/>
There was a little controversy regarding this letterbox and that is <br/>
the reason I posted the note at the end of the clues.<br/>
<br/>
The message on the main list is called "Pandora's Rant", message <br/>
number 27677, dated 6/4/2003. You can pull up this message by typing <br/>
in the number in the search function on the messages page. Once read <br/>

&gt; If you happen to go to Millard Falls letterbox you may want to do a <br/>
&gt; little research on the main LbNA chatlist before going.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There was a little controversy regarding this letterbox and that is <br/>
&gt; the reason I posted the note at the end of the clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The message on the main list is called "Pandora's Rant", message <br/>
&gt; number 27677, dated 6/4/2003. You can pull up this message by typing <br/>
&gt; in the number in the search function on the messages page. Once read <br/>
&gt; then my note may make more sense.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi Bloomin Gramma Jo --<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We haven't explored as far as Pasadena yet, but if you do an <br/>
&gt; Arcadia <br/>
&gt; &gt; search, you'll find a couple of letterboxes in the L.A. County <br/>
&gt; &gt; Arboraetum.  I plan on introducing a friend and her tribe of 4 kids <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing at the Arboraetum tomorrow, so I'll let you know how <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; goes.  We tried to find one of the boxes there, a year ago, without <br/>
&gt; &gt; success, and I was too "green" to have planned ahead and brought a <br/>
&gt; &gt; second set of clues along.  Even without the success of a find, we <br/>
&gt; had <br/>
&gt; &gt; a wonderful day (I have 2 elementary kids, myself) there.  We'll be <br/>
&gt; &gt; trying that one box again, I think -- since others have found it <br/>
&gt; after <br/>
&gt; &gt; me.  (Will have to doublecheck on that.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So glad you'll get to head out this way and visit your kids!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Blessings,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi California! I'm Bloomin Gramma Jo from Texas and mostly lurk <br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; talk list to keep in touch with Calif. My grandkids are in <br/>
&gt; Pasadena, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I'm trying to get them active...I'll be in Pasadena area in a <br/>
&gt; few <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; weeks for a visit, and was wondering if y'all could direct me to <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes to find. What are your recommendations? The g'kids will be in <br/>
&gt; &gt; school so I'll have days to myself. Places to go alone that are <br/>
&gt; safe? <br/>
&gt; &gt; Week-ends of course will be with kids. What would keep their <br/>
&gt; interest? <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for any help/direction you can give.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And I'll gladly return the favor if any of you see the light and <br/>

I actually ended up in Lake Elsinore for New Year's Eve, so I spent<br/>
New Year's Day hunting Katpau's SRP boxes.  Wonderful hikes to missing<br/>
boxes, although one had been replaced by another boxer.  I had a great<br/>
day.  But I'll be heading to Millard Falls soon.<br/>
