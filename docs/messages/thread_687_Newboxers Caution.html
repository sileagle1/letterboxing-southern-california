I've read all the postings in the April Fools' "box" listing and <br/>
found it enlightening... and yes, I do believe I understand that it <br/>
was an April Fool's joke (calling it a box, that is) and is just a <br/>
log of communications with/about the "placer".  Informative!<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year everybody!  I'm off to pack a lunch to take along for <br/>
today's letterboxing outing in Arcadia, CA.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

it, so I deleted the message.  But just communications and not a box<br/>
