can not get back to replace the box timely.<br/>
<br/>
This one is certainly the exception. We have known there was an <br/>
excellant chance this letterbox was missing but we did have every <br/>
intention to replace it. It just took longer than we expected.<br/>
<br/>
Burro Schmidt Tunnel is certanly one of those unusual locations and <br/>
today it has it's letterbox back. It only took us two years to do it.<br/>
