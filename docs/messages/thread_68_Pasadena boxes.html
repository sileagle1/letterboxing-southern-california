                    <div class="plaintext-content">These days, we tend to think of out cities as pretty fireproof and consider ourselves immune from events such as the Great Chicago Fire and the fire after the San Francisco earthquake.  I recall an event about 10-15 years ago that proves that wrong.  It was during a time of high Santa Ana winds that an apartment fire broke out in Anaheim and consumed every building in a six-block area.  It was quite staggering to the mind to see it happening right in front of you when we consider that kind of thing to be something of the past.<br>

The strange thing is that we are getting ash falling from the sky here in the Long Beach area.  My wife (who has a very sensitive sniffer) has been smelling smoke for the past two days.<br>

  Gwen & Don,<br>
  That's an amazing story about your own house being nearly ingulfed by <br>
  a fire--that is so scary.  Our house was not as threatened as yours, <br>
  but a great early 90's fire in our local San Gabriel Mountains did <br>
  destroy homes five blocks away from us, and did devastate Eaton <br>
  Canyon, where some of my letterboxes are now hidden (not hidden at <br>
  the time of the fire).  Wildfires are part of the price we pay for <br>
  living in these beautiful areas.  There are no wildfires in downtown  <br>
  Los Angeles, which is far from the rugged, beautiful mountains.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Earlier today, the Val Verde fire moved incredibly fast into my area <br>
(Moorpark).  It's within a mile of my house, & it appears we've <br>
already lost several homes here.  Things have died down a bit now, <br>
but could get ugly again in the morning if the Santa Anas start back <br>
up, as predicted.<br>
Anyone planning to be in the area Sunday should check ahead.  The 23 <br>
& 118 freeways are both closed here at this time.<br>
