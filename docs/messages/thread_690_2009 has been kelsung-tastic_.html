Our dog is strange.  She likes to come letterboxing with us, however<br/>
that day she had an agenda all her own.  <br/>

I found a muffin and it's wrapper today, but couldn't find eight<br/>
trees.  At this point it seems it's become mandatory for any so-cal<br/>
planter to put a box in Griffith Park.  I'm always going back there. <br/>
Then I was off to West Hollywood.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the new plants.  And now I'm in the early planning stages<br/>
of a new devious puzzle.  By Spring I'll be planting again.<br/>

Aw shucks! That's too bad.  Did you  remember to MUSE  and hum a little COWBOY DITTY?  <br/>
...And was that a Dodgers cap you were wearing? Next time try Angels!   ;)<br/>
