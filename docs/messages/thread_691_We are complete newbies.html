be bad if they made one and changed their stamp to the homemade one<br/>

<br/>
That would be great.  There are no hard rules, so relax.  I used a<br/>
tiny toy stamp for my first dozen finds, then carved a signature stamp<br/>
from some Speedy Cut, which is very crumbly so it didn't last.  My<br/>
third stamp I carved from an eraser and used it for a couple hundred<br/>
boxes and exchanges at three events.  Then I finally carved my newest<br/>
and largest signature stamp last Spring from "the pink stuff" which<br/>
has become my favorite medium.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I can't seem to find the rubber and the carving tools are a bit<br/>
expensive right now after Christmas. So the carving tools will have to<br/>
wait.  I do however have an exacto knife.  Does anyone know where I<br/>
can find the big blocks of rubber, erasers?<br/>
<br/>
Cheap "pink pearl" erasers are a good starting point, and an exacto<br/>
will do for now.  When the budget permits you can check out more<br/>
specialized supplies.<br/>
<br/>
www.letterboxing.org has lots of information.  Check out the FAQ, as<br/>
well as the page on carving tips.  There is also a chatlist like this<br/>
one specifically for new boxers, and I'm sure Don would be able to pop<br/>
in with a link to it.  Mark and Sue Pepe maintain that list, and they<br/>
are really wonderful people.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any tips?  Like my girls are having some difficulty<br/>
stamping the pads on the rocks.  We have tried using the actual<br/>
letterbox I even brought a little carrying box but it still doesn't do<br/>
a very good job of getting a good full complete stamp.<br/>
<br/>
My logbook is a hardcover sketchbook I got at an art supply store, and<br/>
I use it as a level place to stamp into logbooks when in the wild. <br/>
You could carry any medium-sized hardcover book with you to use as a<br/>
surface, I suppose.  I love it when a box is planted near a nice bench....<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hi my name is Heather and I go by Craftlover10101.  My family and I <br/>
&gt; are completely new to Letterboxing but we have already found our <br/>
&gt; first 5 boxes.  ... Does anyone have any tips?   <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to a wonderful family game/sport/obsession ;-)  Here is my<br/>
three-and-a-half cents worth of suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
Use anything you want for your personal stamp(s); feel free to change<br/>
it/them later, if you want to.  No one stays the same through their<br/>
Life; why should our LB icons be static?  I keep saying that I need to<br/>
re-carve our personal stamp.  One of these days, I'll actually *do* it!<br/>
<br/>
You should look for a crafts store that offers classes, to see if any<br/>
of them offer something for carving.  We have a Michaels a half-mile<br/>
from us; they occasionally offer a class in rubber stamping.  Also,<br/>
many communities have Arts Centers that offer classes.  Any such will<br/>
have tools that you can use while you are in the classroom, and you<br/>
can gain a little experience, thus helping you make a good choice when<br/>
you buy your own.  And you might even find some used tools on sale for<br/>
very little money.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, aside from such things as courtesy to others (which<br/>
includes picking up any trash you drop while on the trail), and being<br/>
stealthy in your hunting, even in the wilderness (you never know if a<br/>
hiker is coming from the other direction, even in chaparral-covered<br/>
SoCal), there are very few truly hard-and-fast rules about how you<br/>
box.  We tend to be a little "stricter" than some, but that's in<br/>
regards to maintenance and such; your personal expression should be<br/>
your own, not what others think it should be.<br/>
<br/>
BTW: if you ever decide to look westward for some boxing action, there<br/>
are some good LBs in the Santa Monica Mountains, and as soon as I can<br/>
get my act together and get the house cleaned up from the Holidays,<br/>
there will be more of them.  I love to bake and I love wrapping<br/>
presents; I hate to clean up afterwards :-p<br/>

Here are a few links. The Newboxers list was created because of the <br/>

comments about Mark and Sue and they are sometimes subscribers to this <br/>
list as well.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome aboard, Heather!  We used store-bought stamps for a year <br/>
before biting the bullet and carving our own.  Here's what we used:  <br/>
white rubber eraser (easier than pink, I'm told) and an exacto <br/>
knife.  Draw your design in pencil, then go over it real dark with <br/>
your pencil, then flip it over onto your eraser and scribble all over <br/>
the back side of the paper, thus transfering the design onto your <br/>
eraser.  When deciding what to carve away and what to leave intact, <br/>
remember it's the intact portions that have contact with ink and <br/>
paper, and thus that's what shows up when you "stamp".  Have fun!<br/>

tools are a bit expensive right now after Christmas. So the carving <br/>
tools will have to wait.  I do however have an exacto knife.  Does <br/>
anyone know where I can find the big blocks of rubber, erasers?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any tips?  Like my girls are having some <br/>
difficulty stamping the pads on the rocks.  We have tried using the <br/>
actual letterbox I even brought a little carrying box but it still <br/>
doesn't do a very good job of getting a good full complete stamp.<br/>
&gt; Any tips at all or a website of tips lol.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks Bunches<br/>
