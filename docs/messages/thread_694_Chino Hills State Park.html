"There is no law forbidding geocaching, however we do have laws that <br>
require people to stay on trails in the water canyon preserve. The <br>
entire park has laws preventing the destruction of vegetation which <br>
means you can not dig or cut down any plants.  With that said I think <br>

Well, then, once the area has recovered, perhaps that would still be a<br>
good idea.  A gathering could take this from virgin territory to a<br>
hiking and boxing wonderland.  We'll just need to give it some time.<br>
