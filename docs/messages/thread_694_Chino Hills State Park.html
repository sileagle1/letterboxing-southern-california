I can not recall that there were letterboxes planted in or around Chino <br/>
Hills State Park. <br/>

14,000 acres of park!   13,800 of those acres burned over in November,<br/>
though, and the park is closed until spring while they clear out the<br/>
hazard trees and repair the trails... I'll keep you posted.   punky<br/>

"There is no law forbidding geocaching, however we do have laws that <br/>
require people to stay on trails in the water canyon preserve. The <br/>
entire park has laws preventing the destruction of vegetation which <br/>
means you can not dig or cut down any plants.  With that said I think <br/>
that it is permissible for you to put caches near adjacent trails out <br/>
of the preserve areas and cover them with dead vegetation."<br/>

Well, then, once the area has recovered, perhaps that would still be a<br/>
good idea.  A gathering could take this from virgin territory to a<br/>
hiking and boxing wonderland.  We'll just need to give it some time.<br/>
