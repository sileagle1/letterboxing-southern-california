&gt; Chino Hills SP is in desperate need of a box or two. Not a single <br/>
one in<br/>
&gt; 14,000 acres of park!   13,800 of those acres burned over in <br/>
November,<br/>
&gt; though, and the park is closed until spring while they clear out the<br/>
&gt; hazard trees and repair the trails... I'll keep you posted.   punky<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, I was looking for some good locales for a longer hike. It's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; seems Chino Hills State Park would be a great place for hiking <br/>
(when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's not on fire) and some new plants. Do any of the more<br/>
&gt; experienced<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxers (like Don and CA Bear) recall there ever being any there <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; past? Did some older boxes go missing or run into problems? Or <br/>
is it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; truly virgin territory?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can not recall that there were letterboxes planted in or around<br/>
&gt; Chino<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hills State Park.<br/>

I'd thought about Chino Hills before, but must confess is was because<br/>
of recently looking at those very links that inspired me to want to<br/>
plant there.<br/>
