<br>
Many of you know of my E.T. Phone Home Box.  It is in an area that <br>
had recently been hit by some of the LA fires.  I had gotten reports <br>
about how the box may have been gone...until today.  Check out this <br>
amazing email that I received from KC of Team Serra's Silver... you <br>
can also see pics on KC's blog: <br>

mission-by-taking.html.  Enjoy, and a million thank you's KC!<br>

""I am walking along this small concrete ditch reading the clue as I <br>
go -- 'lala la la la" and as I turn a corner, my mouth drops open. <br>
It's apocalypto. EVERYTHING is burned. Ground black, bushes and trees <br>
just black stalks. It's so weird -- and to top it off it's dry and <br>
windy with the Santa Ana's blowing. And Cold. Thank God I think, so <br>
cold it's a small chance of fire right now. Just a few feet back and <br>
it's a lovely green grass park, turn a corner and it's McCarthy's The <br>
Road. I can't recall what fire it was but I know it was this season <br>
since I remember the freeway closure and I know that our hills <br>
regenerate fast -- there is no green. So I am supposed to follow this <br>
ditch to it's end, where it ends in shrubbery. I'll be looking at a <br>
pink house. All I can see is blackness -- burned out black and yuck. <br>
OH and the pink house? GONE. I see it's fence/deck still hanging over <br>
the edge of it precipice, but it's gone. Shrubbery? A few black <br>
stalks sticking out of the ground.  I see that the edge of the <br>
concrete has broken in the heat and tumbled down the hill a ways. I <br>
search under the edges of the concrete and see not even a melted <br>
trace of letterbox. I keep looking. I shimmy down the hillside a <br>
little bit to see if the broken concrete piece will budge -- no <br>
doing. I stand up in the drainage ditch after checking both sides <br>
again and think CRAP, this thing is just gone. I kept checking <br>
though. Finally I think to pull the clue back out of my pocket and re-<br>
read it. Sure enough it says to look for green graffiti and then look <br>
under the edge where you find it. Hell girl, the graffiti was melted <br>
off the concrete! But I could see trace. So one part of green has <br>
sand up to the edge. I trace back to the end of the ditch and can <br>
barely make out more green. Finally I find a hole (no concrete rock <br>
hiding it anymore as per clue) and there lies the melted remains of a <br>
letterbox. I pull it out -- it's a mass of plastic melt. BUT -- <br>
here's the crazy thing: right in the center of the melt is a <br>
perfectly intact, unmelted stamp!!!!! Can you believe it? There is <br>
one tiny piece of unburned paper towel, but other than that <br>
everything is black and burned or melted. Except the stamp!! It's all <br>
bright and colorful. LOL I am so delighted! I brought it home in a <br>
bag. Going to take pictures before I disassemble it and stamp with <br>
it." So, I have the stamp and the melted box (sorry, hardly a trace <br>
of the logbook in it) and if you don't mind I would like to stamp my <br>
logbook with the amazing fire-proof stamp, before mailing it back. I <br>
will take photos, before and after and will mail all to you (or just <br>
the stamp if you would like) so you can replace it. It was a great <br>
place to hide it. Who knew the fire would come so close?" <br>

Very cool that your stamp is intact. Let me know when you re-plant and the kiddos and I will go off to find it. =)<br>

WOW!  What else can you say?  I regret not going after this one<br>
sooner.  If you replant this with that original stamp, I absolutely<br>
HAVE to find it now.<br>
