Fellow letterboxer Teekasue turned me on to Sterling, and it's been one <br>
of my favorite art stores ever since.  If you're like me, you could <br>
spend hours just wandering the aisles.  Their prices are quite <br>
reasonable (and you get a 15% discount off of everything just for being <br>
a human being!) and they have a lot of stuff you can't find anywhere <br>
else.  They're the only store I know of around here that carries <br>
Speedball carving supplies, and not just the starter kit that you can <br>
sometimes find at Michaels.  They've got handles, blades, pink stuff, <br>
and more.  They've also got stamping and scrapbooking supplies and lots <br>
of paper for logbooks.  And lots of neat sketchbooks-- I got my last <br>
traditional logbook and current postal logbook there.  <br>
<br>
So, if you're ever in the Irvine area, remember to check them out.  <br>
They could use the business.  Oh yeah, and there's free pinball in the <br>
back of the store!<br>

Bay Series were purchased here.  I was actually planning to stop in<br>
Friday evening for some other supplies.  I really hope they don't go<br>
out of business.  They have so much that Michaels lacks.<br>
