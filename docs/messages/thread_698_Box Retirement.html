Would have been a great place for a letterbox, but it was already gone<br/>
when LbNA was in it's infancy.<br/>

&gt; Reminds me of the story of the Mojave Phone Booth:<br/>
<br/>
about a year or two ago I was looking for phone booths to buy for a<br/>
project I was working on and stumbled into the world of the mojave<br/>
phone booth.  It's a damn shame that it no longer exists.  When I got<br/>
into letterboxing that was one of the first things i thought about.<br/>
