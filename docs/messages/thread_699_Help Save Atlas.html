                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our beautiful rescued pit bull Atlas (we found her while letterboxing<br/>
in Griffith Park last summer) was recently diagnosed with a<br/>
transmissible venereal tumor (TVT). This type of tumor is rare in the<br/>
US, and the doctors think she was used as a breeder in a less<br/>
developed country before she was dumped here in Los Angeles. TVT is<br/>
highly responsive to chemotherapy, and Atlas has a great prognosis for<br/>
full recovery. Unfortunately, each weekly chemo treatment costs $250,<br/>
and we are struggling to pay for Atlas' care.<br/>
<br/>
If you are able to make a donation and would like to help save the<br/>
life of this deserving dog, please email us at mkrearick@gmail.com,<br/>

We appreciate any support, no matter what the type.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks,<br/>
