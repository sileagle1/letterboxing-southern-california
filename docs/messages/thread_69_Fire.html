Well, it's morning now and we awoke to the inferno. I hope that you <br>
are ok. the Fontana(Grand Prix) fire is burning very close in <br>
Claremont now. When I first awoke, I thought that perhaps another <br>
fire had started,but was somewhat relieve to hear that it was the <br>
Grand Prix, just moving our way. Purple Iris<br>

couple of days.  Homes a quarter mile from mine were destroyed - too <br>
close for comfort!<br>
BTW, my awesome niece Valerie is down there by you, at Harvey Mudd.  <br>
She caught the letterboxing bug from me, so watch for her stamps!<br>
