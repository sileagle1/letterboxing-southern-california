                    <div class="plaintext-content">*sniffle* Sorry, just mourning box 3 still being missing. The Strange Stamps<br/>
series has been our favorite to collect so far and often is the first we<br/>
suggest families with young kids go after - the location is so wonderful for<br/>
more than just boxing. The day we went, we visited the aviary, played on the<br/>
trains, spent time learning about the area's history from some of the staff,<br/>
interrupted some meeting (woops) and spent half an hour just sitting and<br/>
enjoying the peace of the dwelling next to box #1. And I loved the stamp<br/>
itself for box #3, which is why it is sad to hear it's gone. Maybe someone<br/>
loved it too much?<br/>
<br/>
And the Whittier Semi-Mystery is gone too?! *sniffle* Be sure and holler<br/>
when you re-plant that one - we liked the location enough to go back and<br/>
find the box a second time.<br/>
<br/>
We've gotten 1 of the Eaton Canyon boxes, Buzzard :) We just got hot, mildly<br/>
cranky and made the mistake of going on a popular day - Memorial Day.<br/>
Everyone in LA goes out on the holidays. *points at stamp in boxing<br/>
journals* But see, we made it to one of them *grin* That was the same day<br/>
another letterboxer took a tumble in Eaton Canyon, ironically enough.<br/>
<br/>
We also tried for the Elyria Canyon series before the heat got to us 1/4<br/>
mile into the walk. Fun drive though to get there - rather like a Euro rally<br/>
race without the fans cheering you on.<br/>
<br/>
The ones up in Arrowhead are good for these hot days the next few months.<br/>
Rock Camp was a blast to visit, even without the box, and the creativity of<br/>
hiding place for the Arrowhead Overlook... I'm still trying to figure that<br/>
one out. We're lucky to get 10 minutes alone to hide a box (maybe it is the<br/>
noise created by a mass of chatty kids and adults drawing the attention) and<br/>
that must have taken a bit of time to pull off :)<br/>
<br/>
All these two name handles... hmm, maybe we'll be Gno Sis instead :) We<br/>
don't sign books that way, btw, so don't expect to see that name in your<br/>
log. We are all trying to think of good boxing names during our break from<br/>
hiding - I'm trying to keep it from being a slew of Pokemon character names<br/>
though.<br/>

&gt; *sniffle* Sorry, just mourning box 3 still being missing. The Strange<br/>

<br/>
Doh!    That's a lesson to me!  Even though this series is only 10 minutes<br/>
up the 605 Fwy. from me, I haven't gone after it!  And now one is missing.<br/>
: (<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And the Whittier Semi-Mystery is gone too?! *sniffle* Be sure and holler<br/>

<br/>
Another hop-skip-and-jump away box I missed.  :`(<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That's how it ended up for us.  Hot and cranky, made even worse by going all<br/>
the way to the end of Eaton Canyon to find the Hummingbird box missing.  :<br/>
(  We started working the series backwards.  We started with the box<br/>
furthest in and were going to work our way back out which is not how Buzzard<br/>
intended us to do it.  ; )<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yowza!  Last time I looked (albeit, back in March) there were no boxes in<br/>
the Arrowhead/Big Bear area.  Now I see tons of them!  Someone has been busy<br/>
up there!!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We are all trying to think of good boxing names during our break from<br/>
&gt; hiding - I'm trying to keep it from being a slew of Pokemon character<br/>
names<br/>
&gt; though.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with Pokemon names!  When they get older, it'll be skate and<br/>
surfing names.  My son chose Osiris.  I was impressed with his knowledge of<br/>
Egyptian mythology till I found it was a skate company and he wanted to use<br/>
their logo for his stamp.  : )<br/>
