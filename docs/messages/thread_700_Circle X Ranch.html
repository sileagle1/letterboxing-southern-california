guess you could call me a free-lance engineer.  Due to recently<br/>
picking up some new regular work, my days off won't be anymore for a<br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
So today was going to be my last day letterboxing for probably quite a<br/>
while.  I wanted to make it worth it, so I decided to seek out my Holy<br/>
Grail:  "Circle X Ranch" the oldest box in California.<br/>
<br/>
I drove out there early and took my time hiking, taking in some great<br/>
views on a perfect day.  I was only the 8th finder of the box since<br/>
Don and PeterK replanted it in 2004.<br/>
<br/>
Then I continued along the trail, heading for Tri-Peaks.  PeterK had<br/>
also planted a box there, so I was after both.  After a serious hike<br/>
up, I was blessed with an absolutely amazing view.  I looked where the<br/>
clues instructed, but no box.  I scoured the area, checking ever<br/>
possible rock and plant, but to no avail.  I finally gave up, but<br/>
didn't feel disappointed.  After all, I'd had a great hike on a<br/>
beautiful day and got an awesome view on the world below.<br/>
<br/>
As I relaxed in the afternoon sun, I noted a small cave about halfway<br/>
up the sheer rock face that comprised the last fifty or so feet to the<br/>
peak.  I decided I was going to get daring and climb up to take a look<br/>
inside.  It was a hole about three feet in diameter that went back<br/>
about five feet into the rock, and lo and behold, there was the<br/>
tattered remains of a broken letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Upon further inspection, it appeared I was doing four hobbies<br/>
simultaneously.  There were three weathered logbooks:  PeterK's, an<br/>
apparent geocache, and a summit log full of notes from people who<br/>
climbed all the way up here.  Torn bags, a soup can, pencil and after<br/>
digging around, the stamp.  And at the base below where the box was<br/>
supposed to be I'd already taken a photo of a benchmark.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing, geocaching, benchmark hunting, and a summit log all in<br/>
one place.  And the reason was obvious: a million dollar view.  I<br/>
replaced baggies for all the logs, but since the container was<br/>
smashed, I left it all in a freezer bag up in the cave out of the<br/>
weather and away from wildlife.  I told Peter he should change the<br/>
listing to an extreme letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Then I spent the evening with Zuhl, Maule and Buffalo Tony at a comedy<br/>
show and late dinner.  All in all, pretty much a perfect day.<br/>

Great story!  This box has been high on our List for quite a while, as<br/>
well.  We live just a few miles, straight-line, from here, and have<br/>
been up to Sandstone Peak in the past, but not in about three years. <br/>
There are several geocaches, including two Earthcaches that the<br/>
National Park Service set up, in the general area of Sandstone and<br/>
Tri-Peaks.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we'll have to make our foray up there sooner rather than<br/>
later.  We can bring a replacement container along for the LB :-)  How<br/>
big was the original, do you think?  Does it need a new logbook?  And<br/>
should we put it back where the clues would have it (assuming we find<br/>
the right spot), or should we leave it in the little "cave".  Can't<br/>
tell exactly which geocache that might be, but we'll find out when/if<br/>
we find it, and we can certainly set things up so that any cachers who<br/>
come along (pretty rare in that area, and most of them will know the<br/>
difference) won't disturb it.  <br/>
<br/>
What do the owners want us to do, if anything?  We are quite willing<br/>
to give a go at fixing things, but if they would rather we not, that's<br/>
cool, especially if they are planning to go up there themselves.  The<br/>
main question from our PoV is exactly *when* we would go up there. <br/>
Could be within a couple of weeks, or it might be rather later,<br/>
depending upon the weather.<br/>
<br/>
Have to look for the benchmark, while we are at it :-)  It isn't in<br/>
the NGS database; the nearest listed one is almost a mile away from<br/>
Sandstone Peak.<br/>
