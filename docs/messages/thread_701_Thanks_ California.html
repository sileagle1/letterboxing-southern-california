California. Wanted to say thanks to all you wonderful Cal boxers. I <br/>
had hoped to spend several days on the trails while grandkids were in <br/>
school, but with cheerleading, drama practice and dance lessons to <br/>
attend, l'boxing took a back seat. <br/>
Did manage one day out climbing Echo Mountain. Wow! Well worth the <br/>
climb. It was just Gramma and Mom with 2 pre-teens and a 5-yr-old, <br/>
and the dog, as Dad was away on business. Which meant we had to <br/>
figure a way to coax the 5yo up the hill, not having daddy's <br/>
shoulders to ride on. Back packs filled with picnic and lots of <br/>
water, jogging stroller borrowed from friend (up the mountain? are <br/>
you crazy?), off we went.<br/>
Counted steps to Echo Mountain Box #1, and stamped in while trail was <br/>
miraculously empty. Mom pushed that stroller over rock and stump, 5yo <br/>
riding on the smooth sections, dog taking a break or two when the <br/>
stroller was empty. <br/>
Made it to the top, and the view was well worth all the effort. <br/>
Wonderful! It was one of those beautiful clear blue days with gentle <br/>
breeze that can only be found in southern Calif.<br/>
Duly located Box #2 and #3, altho #3 missing stamp and log book. Also <br/>
found a little rabbit hiding in a hole with a HH snuggled with him.<br/>
Read all the info posts, maraveled at the ruins, and shouted our <br/>
echos to the mountain in the echo phone. Great fun.<br/>
Trekking back down the mountain found a place to plant another box to <br/>
add to the interest. Here is link if anyone is interested. <br/>

Thanks to Koritzke family and VIENNA for your plants, and to all you <br/>
on this list who gave suggestions on where to find boxes while on my <br/>
visit.<br/>
