The Modern Woodcut which chronicles select artists from 1870s through<br/>

read about this yesterday and plan to go on Thursday when the museum<br/>
is free to everyone.  I wish I had found out earlier because the show<br/>
closes on the 8th.  Woodcuts have always been fascinating to me and<br/>
even more so now that I have been expanding beyond the rubber into<br/>
wood and linoleum.  Actively letterboxing has made me a better artist<br/>
because I start to look at everything differently; how would that<br/>
carve, how would the colors reduce to a simple black and white, what<br/>
kind of shading techniques can i use.  My carving skills aren't great,<br/>
by any means, but I'm greatly improving with every new stamp I carve.<br/>
 Has anyone else branched out from carving stamps to any other form of<br/>
art?  Anyone here do linoleum or woodcuts?  What about whittling? <br/>
whittling is another hobby that I explore.  It's really rewarding,<br/>
wood to knife, seeing the three dimensional object start to take shape<br/>
with every curl of wood that hits the ground.<br/>
<br/>
I'll let everyone know how the hammer was and if it was as inspiring<br/>
as I hope it will be.<br/>

I've too much to do.  I'm a newbie carver, so I'll be sticking with <br/>
the softer materials for awhile, at least, but please do let us know <br/>
how you enjoyed the exhibition and what you came away with (learning <br/>
or inspiration-wise... or even if you picked up some related item in <br/>
the museum gift shop).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Gouge was really great.  I was a little disappointed by the final<br/>
room, but practically everything else was very cool.  There were a few<br/>
pieces that were over 12 feet wide and one that must have been 15 feet<br/>
tall.  They included a few of the actual woodcuts themselves, from<br/>
older pieces.  Surprisingly they were in all really good condition. <br/>
They had one anonymous cut from the early 1900s that was carved by a<br/>
Monk and it was the cleanest thing I had ever seen.  The recessed cuts<br/>
were so flat that you had to look really hard to see where the gouge<br/>
marks were.  the exposed lines were so perfect it was hard to believe<br/>
that this was done by a human.  As my friend Palmer pointed out "They<br/>
were monks, what else ..."<br/>
<br/>
There were some neat contemporary pieces there too.  A los angeles<br/>
area artist took images from a CCTV and using only one field of the<br/>
image transferred it to a piece of wood about 6 feet wide and just<br/>
carved out the scan lines.  From far away it looks like a strange<br/>
photograph but upclose it looks like a zebra.  Seeing the way the<br/>
artists tackled the faces gave me some ideas on how to improve the<br/>
facial features of my own carvings.  <br/>
<br/>
After seeing some of these masterworks (there were cuts from Munch,<br/>
Mattise and Picasso to name a few), I have seen quality work, carved<br/>
into rubber, sitting in tupperware containers...<br/>
