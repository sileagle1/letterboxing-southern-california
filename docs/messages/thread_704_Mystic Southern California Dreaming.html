&gt; &gt; Hmm,  Somehow I knew Kelsung was going to choose Souplantation ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Is it pronounced Sou-Plantation? (as in the french coin of small <br/>
&gt; &gt; denomination)?Or Soup-Lantation (I have no idea what a Lantation <br/>
is)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I too vote for the Souplantation.  Very possibly my <br/>
inlaws <br/>
&gt; &gt; (Fleetwood7) from the bay area will be down here as well.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I can be there, but a little later (hopefully by 7:00) once I <br/>
get <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; work.  Either restaurant would be fine, but if forced to <br/>
