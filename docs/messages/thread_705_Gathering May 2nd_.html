Kisma of Reidling Trinity, Lydia of Take A Hike Club and I (Tdyans)<br>
are putting our heads together for another gathering.  See details at<br>
the link, sign up, and let me know if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
Also, many of you have expressed an interest in helping out.  Here are<br>
a few ways you could contribute:<br>
<br>
*On April 18th (weather permitting), I'm hoping to get several people<br>
together to plant boxes for the gathering.  There are lots of trails<br>
in this park, and we want to cover them all, so if we get a good<br>
group, we can split up into smaller groups and each cover a certain<br>
area.  AQ-mail me if you want to help with this.<br>
<br>
*If you have any supplies that might help-- no-cootie stickers, boxes,<br>
western-style decorations, a canopy, etc.-- let us know.<br>
<br>
*If you have items you'd like to donate for a giveaway/raffle, please<br>
contact Take A Hike Club on AQ.<br>
<br>
*As you can see, we want to get our "planned" activities out of the<br>
way by noon so everyone can have the majority of the day to letterbox<br>
and socialize, so we don't need a ton of activities.  But if you've<br>
got a class you'd like to teach or anything like that, let me know.<br>
<br>
Most of all, you can make this a great gathering by just coming, of<br>
course!  And if there's anything I've forgotten or if you have any<br>
questions, please ask.  <br>

Perhaps they'll have a picture of Don's angry face to intimidate the <br>
