&gt; I'd be glad to make the NO COOTIE Stickers! Sign me up!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Perhaps they'll have a picture of Don's angry face to intimidate <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; cooties! =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; It's here!  http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1143<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Kisma of Reidling Trinity, Lydia of Take A Hike Club and I <br/>
(Tdyans)<br/>
&gt; &gt; are putting our heads together for another gathering.  See <br/>
details <br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the link, sign up, and let me know if you have any questions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, many of you have expressed an interest in helping out.  <br/>
Here <br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; a few ways you could contribute:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; *On April 18th (weather permitting), I'm hoping to get several <br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; together to plant boxes for the gathering.  There are lots of <br/>
trails<br/>
&gt; &gt; in this park, and we want to cover them all, so if we get a good<br/>
&gt; &gt; group, we can split up into smaller groups and each cover a <br/>
certain<br/>
&gt; &gt; area.  AQ-mail me if you want to help with this.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; *If you have any supplies that might help-- no-cootie stickers, <br/>
&gt; boxes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; western-style decorations, a canopy, etc.-- let us know.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; *If you have items you'd like to donate for a giveaway/raffle, <br/>
&gt; please<br/>
&gt; &gt; contact Take A Hike Club on AQ.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; *As you can see, we want to get our "planned" activities out of <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; way by noon so everyone can have the majority of the day to <br/>
&gt; letterbox<br/>
&gt; &gt; and socialize, so we don't need a ton of activities.  But if <br/>
you've<br/>
&gt; &gt; got a class you'd like to teach or anything like that, let me <br/>
know.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Most of all, you can make this a great gathering by just coming, <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; course!  And if there's anything I've forgotten or if you have any<br/>
&gt; &gt; questions, please ask.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
