                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went letterboxing on Valentines day and found this box.  Such a cute stamp.  However the lake itself was pretty sad on the eyes.  We learned a great deal from the little ladies in the visitor center which of course is free.  They were very happy to have people there interested in how things work, to learn the history, and about the lake.  However the museum across the way is $8 per person. The website we visited did not state this.   There is also a gift/souv. shop there also.  <br/>
We did pay the $7 fee to park up at the lake to take the trail to find our box.  The signs are very tricky.... lol  But we found it and everyone was happy.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I would like to say, even though I am new to letterboxing...Please be careful when handling these stamps.  And always carry a bottle of water with you.  Who ever had found it before us had dropped it in the dirt and it had dirt stuck in all of the grooves.  Very sad, it wouldn't stamp and than I said well let's clean it.  Hubby was afraid too but I told him who ever owns it would not want it left like this so I put little drops of water on it and cleaned the grooves out.  (don't drowned it with water, just enough to get it cleaned up) Wiped it off and and it worked just fine.  <br/>
