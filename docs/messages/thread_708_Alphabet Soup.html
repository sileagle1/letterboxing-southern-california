&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After two months of preparations, I finally planted my biggest puzzle<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yet.  Some of you, I know, have already been stumbling upon bits,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wondering what to do with them.  As of today, a clue has now been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; posted.  Or rather, the lack of a clue.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Enjoy.<br/>

I'm not giving anything away by letting you know that the box is located inside a business.  And the business may be closing.  I'm not certain that it is, and I've been assured by some staff that it isn't, but there have been persistent rumors swirling for a while now.  It is certainly a very real possibility, as the box was placed there partly in honor of a previous box that I retired when a similar business closed.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that this box will remain viable for years to come, but just to be fair to those who may have already invested some time into it, I thought it important to let you know it may not.  I have often doled out hints over the years as to where to look for some of the twenty-six pieces of the clue (one is just a click away as you read this).  I intend to be even more liberal with my assistance from now on, and you may wish to hit up any of the finders for help, too.  I state right in the clue that I encourage the sharing of information for this box.<br/>
