It is in Oxnard -- you are basically right on the beach. With the magic of google maps, you can see what the sites look like... <br/>
<br/>
According to my 2001 copy of California Camping, they do allow dogs. You should probably call and check though -- I suspect dogs are not allowed on the beach proper. <br/>
<br/>
California Camping 2001 claims that the following also have pet-allowed camping near beaches:<br/>
 - Big Sycamore Canyon (in Pt Mugu state park -- on the wrong side Hwy 1)<br/>
 - Thornhill Broome State Beach (also Pt Mugu, on ocean side of 1)<br/>
 - Leo Carrillo State Park (north of malibu)<br/>
 - Doheney State Beach (Dana point)<br/>
 - San Clemente State Beach <br/>
 - San Onofre State beach<br/>
<br/>
I think all of these can be reserved online at <br/>
http://www.reserveamerica.com/<br/>
<br/>
(note that according to reserve america, the only one of these that allows pets is Doheny SB.. .so you might want to check with each one to be sure).<br/>

&gt; &gt;    - Leo Carrillo State Park  (north of malibu)<br/>
&gt; &gt;    - Doheney State Beach  (Dana point)<br/>
&gt; &gt;    - San Clemente State Beach<br/>
&gt; &gt;    - San Onofre State beach<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think all of these can be reserved online at<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  (note that according to reserve america, the only one of these that <br/>
&gt; allows pets is Doheny SB.. .so you might want to check with each one <br/>
&gt; to be sure).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Molly has spring break in a few weeks (WOOOO SPRING BREAK!!1) and we <br/>
&gt; want to go camping somewhere quiet where we'll be able to hear the <br/>
&gt; ocean at night. The real trick is that we have a letterboxing- dog <br/>
&gt; that would be very upset if we didn't bring her with us. Anyone have <br/>
&gt; any suggestions where we can camp on a beach (or at the very least <br/>
&gt; NEAR the beach).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I've had a hard time finding a campground that accepts animals so if <br/>
&gt; anyone has good experiences please share. We're willing to head up to <br/>
&gt; Ventura County or down to Orange County.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So soCal, what do you think?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since you're willing to travel to Ventura County... how about El Capitan State Beach, 20-30 minutes' drive north of Santa Barbara?<br/>
<br/>
Someone else has already given you the www.reserveamerica.com website; even if you can't find an opening there online, look up and write down the phone number so that you can check by phone.<br/>
<br/>
Last Spring, my husband called a week (or less) before Easter Vacation, and got us several days at El Capitan State Beach.<br/>
<br/>
While there, we letterboxed and found Painted Cave (watch out for poison oak), and tried a couple of others without finding the boxes.  AT El Capitan State Beach, there's a letterbox called, "Finding Your Way With GS," which was reported at the time as "missing" and which is now listed as "abandoned," but here's what the website can't tell you until someone checks it out and gets back to me:  my GS daughter and I followed the clues last April and replanted the box, using things we had with us on our camping trip.  <br/>
<br/>
I have since been able to contact the planter, and she'd be happy for me to adopt the box officially; however first we need someone to go there and search for the box, and see if it survived the rains, squirrels, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you're able to get a spot at El Capitan (or even Refugio State Beach, also nearby), would you please check and see if you can find "Finding Your Way with GS"?  (If you have trouble accessing the clues online, let me know -- I have a copy.)<br/>
<br/>
As for your dog question, when you make the reservations, you tell them you'd like to bring your dog.  Bring your proof of rabies vaccination, to show to them when you check-in.  Dogs ARE allowed to camp; they just aren't allowed on the beach.  Tied-up during the day, and brought indoors at night.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We camped recently at San Clemente.  It is a big campground that allows tent camping and dogs.  It's not ON the beach, it's on the cliffs above the beach, but has an easy walk down to the water.  We camped in the hook-up sites where we could mostly hear the traffic from the freeway.  Some of the tent sites are in further and closer to the edge of the cliff and the beach. We thought it was a very nice campground.  My camping group was at Carlsbad recently, too.  I didn't go, so not sure about the accommodations.  <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>
