The original purpose of them was to highlight Acres Of Books, which closed last October, so the series has lost its mojo.  For any of you newer boxers who never had a chance to visit, here's a little of what you missed:<br>

I'm sure that link won't be around for long, and here's another to tell you why:<br>

<br>
I think I'll create a new Long Beach Series that highlights some the same locations (Bluff Park, The Museum Of Art, etc) that the series took you to, but probably not till this summer, after I've done some other replacements.  Sadly, The Yellow Flower just came up missing also, apparently thanks to some city workers.<br>

Kelsung also gave us a heads up that our Pub Crawl Letterboxes may be missing. I tried to edit clues this morning but found I couldn't access AQ or LbNA. I'll give it a go later.<br>

My favorite part, the little different rooms, like the "War room" with  <br>
books on wars.<br>
There was a little sign posted "War Room:  Please, no fighting in the war  <br>
room"<br>
