My favorite box (Day of the Dead Couple) that I planted is at the Mission San Luis Rey in Oceanside. It's only a couple of miles from the harbor (if that's where hubby will be fishing out of). Don't go to A Drop of Snow as there is construction going on there and I'm not sure the box is available yet. Calico Cat isn't too far off the beaten path and the hike is fairly short.<br/>
Good luck. Hope you find some good boxes. I haven't been out in a few months but heard there are some new ones around. Make sure you check to see when they were last found before you make any attempt to find some of them. Like the Who's Who series is pretty much missing all of its stamps.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ahhhh... had a lovely weekend in San Diego, with the exception of my son losing his lunch at San Diego Zoo (but a kind employee gave us a ride to our car) and it was really the end of our day there, with a long walk ahead of us to GET to our car -- and then while my son slept it off at camp, my daughter was on the playground, a boy fell and got his lip split -- and blamed it on our daughter!  (My dear hubby lost some sleep that night, as the father was considering having us pay the medical bill.)<br/>
<br/>
On our way home Sunday, I was determined to letterbox and my poor exhausted husband just wanted to get out of there.  Nevertheless, since it was my "birthday trip" he had pity on me and let us stop and do two:<br/>
<br/>
Dragonfly (Gave it a little TLC and a new logbook.)<br/>
<br/>
I-5 Hippy Love Van (Glad the clues said a new logbook was needed, so I had one along for Dragongly.  I-5 HLV's owner hadn't been advised that someone already replaced the logbook last March.)  My HUSBAND, the one who only letterboxes under duress, found this letterbox -- maybe that's a small beginning for him to start enjoying it.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoyed lunch in Carlsbad, and had an uneventful drive home (I drove from then on, so my hubby could sleep.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanking God that our weekend didn't result in a $700 (or whatever) medical bill, and that the boy will be just fine, once his lip heals.  It think it helped the dad to hear about when our daughter's lip was split and what the emergency room doctor said about that.  (The mouth heals quickly and, the only reason they gave her stitches was that the split was also into the face area.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the enthusiastic response from everybody, and special thanks to Scraphappy and Flattire, for the letterboxes!<br/>
