He's disappeared from his last hiding place but I haven't heard from anyone. <br>
<br>
Alas,  Wandering Watch has gone missing. I got a msg. from a kind boxer letting me know they found only the bottom of the box, and when I went to confirm I found one of my labeled baggies. The area has changed a bit since I placed the box in 2005 so I won't be replacing it. <br>
<br>
Auld Lang Syne was scheduled to retire at the end of February but I was busy. When I went to remove it a week later, someone had stamped in just a few hours earlier . Good timing, BBB!  <br>
Happy boxing everyone!<br>
