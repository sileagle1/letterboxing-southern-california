<br>
We spent an enjoyable afternoon today boxing in Altadena -- Millard Falls and Eaton Canyon.  While at Eaton Canyon, we looked for "Other Canyon Series" #4, since it was also nearby.On the streambed where one would stamp box #4, there was a necklace that said "Chi, Life, Energy" or something to that effect, with a chinese character.  Since no one had found that box for 4 or 5 years, I sort of doubt it was a letterboxer ... but stranger things have happened.<br>
<br>
We left the necklace in the box (which hopefully does not make it a geocache!)<br>
<br>
It was kind of neat finding a box that has been in place for 5+ years, but that no one has found in a long long time.  I wasn't really expecting to find the boxes there at all -- which makes it even cooler to find them.  Same thing happened at Descanso Gardens a few weeks back.  In both instances, these were really nice stamps, in great locations, that people seem to have forgotten.  <br>
<br>
  Also, as an aside, it is surprising the number of store bought signature stamps that I see in some of the older logbooks (circa 2004)...<br>
