Hi, I just signed up for your group. I'm trying to make arrangements to come<br/>
into SoCal for the event on May 2nd and a nonletterboxing event on May 3rd<br/>
during my move from AZ to WA. I need a place to park my motor home for three<br/>
nights that is free or cheap, no hookups required. A church parking lot, in<br/>
front of a home, whatever. I am fully self-contained and have a car to get<br/>
to the events. Motor home is 38 feet. The cheapest RV park I've found is<br/>
$50/night and way out of my ability to pay. Help/suggestions welcome. (I<br/>
already contacted the regional park of the event; no large vehicle parking<br/>
is available.)<br/>
