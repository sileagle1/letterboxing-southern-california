                    <div class="plaintext-content">I posted a while back about Sterling Art in Irvine being in danger of having to close.  Well, the good news is, they're not going to close, but they are going to move.  The even better news is, they're having a moving sale, with 40% off of everything in the store!  They're only planning on staying in the old building until the 20th, so it's just for a few days.<br>
