<br>
My first plant, placed 2/4/09, had two visitors, plus myself (to check on it), and then the third seeker discovered on 3/16/09 that it had gone missing.  <br>
<br>
The stamp has been recarved, a new letterbox made, a new hiding place found, and all clues upgraded.  Hopefully, it'll last a lot longer this time -- although it IS a high traffic area, so patience is required for the area to clear before finding and then again for rehiding the box.<br>
<br>
Since it isn't a "new" box, it isn't going to pop to the top of the list on AtlasQuest, and so that's why I'm letting you know, here.  <br>
<br>
(And Trader Joe's is across the street from Michillinda Park... one of our favorite places to shop.)<br>
<br>
Bon Apetit! - I mean, "Happy Hunting!"<br>
<br>
Blessings,<br>
