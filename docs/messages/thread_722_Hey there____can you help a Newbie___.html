<br/>
Welcome to the addiction.<br/>
<br/>
I think that your title in the subject line will be your salvation.<br/>
<br/>
We all seem to screw up when we get started so your slip up won't get jumped on by me.<br/>
<br/>
So what is your screw up? ......Mentioning Mystery clue info publically.<br/>
<br/>
Since it was Kelsung's evil creation it would be fine to contact him off list and ask him what ever you want. He on the otherhand may or may not give you answers, atleast those answers that won't tease the heck out of you.<br/>
<br/>
There are several similar info dumps in other boxes so this one publically mentioned listing should not hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Erasers:<br/>
<br/>
Most carvers don't use erasers but use carving material. Carving materials are "Pink Stuff", "PZ Kut white or orange",or "Master Carve". Many of us get our supplies at <br/>
<br/>
http://www.stampeaz.com/<br/>
<br/>
Tutorials/stamp samples can be found at <br/>
<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/tutorials/carving/samples.html<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in archives of this chatlist you will find more info on Kelsung's  evilness as well as a craft store that Tdyans mentioned about carving supplies.<br/>
<br/>
Also in other areas of this chatlist (and other chatlists) you may find hidden secrets to letterboxes either in clues or partial clues.<br/>
<br/>
When finding those gems just keep the info off the public channels and enjoy.<br/>

&gt; Inside Kelsung's letterbox  there is a clue for another letterbox - It says <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 &gt; What does this mean???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks so any who can answer. I just found out about letterboxing a couple weeks ago and already have found about 12. It is so fun!!<br/>
&gt; I carved my own stamp in an eraser and can't wait to start planting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW... Does anyone know who stocks superwide erasers?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thanks!<br/>

Sorry about the info. I purposely didn't include all the clues but I now I know I should put any!<br/>
<br/>
I did email Kelsung a week ago and got no response but thanks so much for your help. I truly appreciate it!<br/>
