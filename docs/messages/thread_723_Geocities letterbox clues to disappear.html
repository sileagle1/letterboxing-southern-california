<br>
I'm sure you've heard by now that the free yahoo GeoCities websites are all going to evaporate at the end of the year. More info on this is here: <br>
<http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/geocities/geocities-05.html><br>
<br>
Letterboxers would hate to see these clues disappear. We have plenty of time to spread awareness of this coming problem to people who use Geocities and to help them find alternatives, but we could use the help of the regional letterboxing groups.<br>
<br>
If you know someone who uses Geocities for their clues, please try and contact them and let them know what is happening. They can send any quesitons about possible solutions to the webmasters at letterboxing.org<br>
<br>
Folks with only a few letterbox clues on geocities may want to cut and paste them into both letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com. Or they could move them to another ISP and keep their clues as html pages if they prefer. I think they could also start paying for Geocities and then they would keep their websites intact. If there is anything we can do to help with the process, please don't hesitate to ask.<br>
<br>
In a few weeks we hope to have a group of volunteers working to ferret out clues, contact box planters, and to facilitate adopting geocities boxes of inactive boxers. Hopefully we will be working both with letterboxing.org and with atlasquest.com on this project.<br>
<br>
Sorry to bring bad news and extra work to your day, but happy letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Jay in CT<br>

Even though it's "going away," I'd be curious to take a peek at the GeoCities letterbox site.  Are you able to give me the link?  Even though it might only remain valid for a week or two, I'm curious to see if any boxes in my area might be listed there.<br>

Thanks!<br>

Some letterboxers have clues listed on their own sites instead of LBNA or AQ,  and that any such sites which happen to be Geocities accounts will be disappearing along with their clues. So he's talking about a lot of sites and no central index.  Some people plant great letterboxes and them move on  to other interests, leaving their clues untended even though the boxes are still out there being maintained by finders who replace logbooks or baggies, etc. <br>
It's the clues of such inactive boxers that would disappear, even though their boxes might still be out there, waiting patiently for visitors...   *cue violin music* <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There used to be a link to the "Letterboxing Web Ring" posted on the bottom of the LbNA home page. That Web Ring had many listings that went to Geocities clues. I see that the Web Ring is no longer posted at the bottom now, but from my recollection there was only one letterboxer that had letterboxes (2) listed in SoCal and that was Grey Squirrel and her boxes were also posted on LbNA. You could research the basement(listed at LbNA home page) for other Geocities listings but I'm pretty sure there weren't any other SoCal letterboxers that used Geocities.<br>
<br>
If you are not familiar with the basement then you might enjoy the trip through it. Not all of those are missing??<br>
