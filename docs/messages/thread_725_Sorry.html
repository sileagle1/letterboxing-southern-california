Hello!  Just sticking my head above water again.  Although facing some serious personal financial issues of late, I promise to longer be absent from the internet.  A certain fried hard-drive was to blame there, and the loss of a few bonus box clues was nothing as compared to my iTunes library!!  (Back-up! Back-up! Back-up, you fool!!)<br>
<br>
Having missed the Round Up and a planned trip to Reno, I got on tonight to learn I just missed a mini-meet in Seal Beach as well.  Alas!<br>
<br>
Thinking I would need a bit of catching up to do out in Irvine Park, my LB agenda has also lengthened thanks to a certain yellow-tinted lizard invading the parks in my local neighborhoods, and I look forward to discovering his handiwork.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, I have some maintenance to attend to on several boxes before I plan to dive into some new plants.  But I posted here in reply to Don, for he is correct to guess that, in spite of my absence from a computer, my mind has been spinning some new webs.  It may be some bit of time yet, but several insidious new clues are coming.<br>
<br>
To give a bit of a teaser, I'd actually already conceived of a clue I intended to call "Prism" when, coincidentally, Laserium has recently reopened in Hollywood, providing a perfect locale.  For those who play card games, keep an eye out for "Bridge", for the spiritual I still hope (though it will be difficult) to plant "Matthew 7:7", and code-breakers will be asked to look to "The Heavens" as well as a box I intend to title simply "$".<br>
<br>
And will there be a bonus mystery connected with these mind-numbing puzzles?  Of course not.  I never create bonus boxes.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny I should read this today, when JUST THIS MORNING I had convinced myself the "yellow-tinted lizard" was actually Kelsung, after an absurdly large number of boxes that only someone of Kelsung's caliber could pull-off well, have been popping up everywhere. And then I logged on and saw that someone else was also thinking the same. <br>
<br>
But I feel much better knowing that I don't need to go crazy thinking there is some big plan I need to figure out. :)<br>
<br>
So sorry to have missed everyone at the gathering this weekend-- just got back from Mexico Saturday night. <br>
<br>
Have a wonderful day and smile! Hope you are well, Kelsung.<br>

More boxes coming, eh?  I think I still need some 13 clues still, before I can begin to try and solve Alphabet Soup.<br>
<br>
And... though I've finally watched the movie and know "the answer" it doesn't really bring me much closer to figuring out that Bonus Box I picked up last summer.<br>
<br>
Codes and ciphers.... a brand new way of thinking (to me) -- and yet... I was the first to solve the puzzle in a fun kids' book I picked up at a Los Angeles County library -- (meaning I beat the kids at it... and they aren't finished figuring it out, 2 weeks later)...<br>
<br>
Folks might enjoy trying to solve it -- you can request it to be transferred to a L.A. County Library more local to you, if your branch doesn't carry the book:<br>

All these quick and warm replies reminds me why I love the people this hobby has introduced me to.<br>
<br>
By the by, California Bear briefly reappeared last winter, then quickly vanished again.  He also lives relatively close to me, so I actually suspected that HE may be the Gecko.<br>
<br>
But more likely it's just a new boxer who caught the planter bug right away.  I'd only found 6 boxes before planting my first, and after another dozen finds, I planted 16 more within 2 months.  I clearly go in bursts, because I've gone year-long stretches with only one or two new ones, but I dropped 25 in your laps last December to February.<br>
<br>
However, since I just checked today that she's fine and dandy, I thought I'd mention that last summer's Legend of Zelda seems to have been forgotten amidst all those new ones.<br>

Now you have bunches of letterboxes to find, even a new one in Seal Beach. See AQ for "A Moose hits the Beach".<br>
