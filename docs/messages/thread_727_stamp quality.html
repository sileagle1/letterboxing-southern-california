                    <div class="plaintext-content">How important is it to have a really well carved stamp? My first two boxes (one of which is about ready to be placed) have my first official stamp carvings. Both are crude because I carved them with an empty pencil, like they tell kids to do on the tutorial pages. I am waiting for my carving kit to come in the mail. When it comes I can make better stamps for both but the problem is that I really like the one that I am about to plant. It embodies the things that I wanted it to.<br>
My question is, are you offended when you get a box with a crude stamp, or do you take early boxes at face value and expect more from the next one. I would really like to keep this stamp, but I don't want people to think that my boxes aren't worth the visit because it is a beginner quality.<br>
Thanks for the feedback.<br>

You know what I like almost as much as a good stamp?  A good story that goes with the stamp!  I think you just gave a great story and you could even say in the clues or the log book, this is my first carve, may not be the greatest thing, but I am proud of it :-) and tell us why!<br>

I have been trying to think of a good series to carve for a year now.  Still have carved nothing.  Except our own stamp and my sister's family.<br>

<br>
Absolutely not!  While I'm not thrilled with store-bought stamps, I've only been letterboxing about 18 months, and used a store-bought stamp for my first 11 months.  My current signature stamp is my first carving and is really nothing more than an eraser with "Hansenclan" carved into it.  I finally began to learn carving for participation in Postal Letterboxes, and have carved 11 stamps now, both for postals and also for five boxes that I'm planning on planting.<br>
<br>
All of us fall somewhere within quite a range of talent and experience, and I think all of us appreciate any effort made.  That includes someone planting with a storebought stamp:  the effort to create clues and a fun letterboxing experience has still been made.<br>
<br>
Your efforts, crude or refined, are always welcomed.  My "postal" friends were always very gracious and encouraging about my stamps, and never left me feeling I should have done a better job.  Even after I saw some of THEIR magnificent carvings!<br>
<br>
I'm glad you're making the effort, and wish we lived nearby so we could see your carvings and search for your box(es) ourselves.<br>

I really like it, and when I read that poorly done stamps might be looked on badly I was nervous.

The great thing about boxing is that there are so many different elements.  Sometimes it's the stamp, sometimes it's the location, sometimes it's the clues, sometimes it's the hike.  But it's always someone's effort.<br>
<br>
The extremely rare letterbox that I didn't enjoy was because of the obvious lack of effort.  You've clearly put effort into this carve.  Plant your box.  I will be very proud to add your "crude" stamp to my logbook.<br>

There are a few more in the works up here too, so you might enjoy an Apple Valley boxing day when you get the chance. Plus, the personal traveler I carved came out pretty awesome (in my opinion) and you have to get a stamp of it too. If you can figure out what it is, that is. ;-)<br>
