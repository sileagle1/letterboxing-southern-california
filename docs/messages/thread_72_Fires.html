I heard this morning that some fires have started out there in CO.  As for here, things are cooling off a lot and there is a 40-50% chance of rain this weekend so that should help a lot.  Unfortunately, it is too late for the 1000s who have lost homes.  I think the latest count was over 2000 homes lost as well as 30 known deaths.  There are fire officials that are saying the count may rise as the fires are extinguished and they can get in to check the fire areas.<br/>

&gt; up here to help handle letterbox evacuations ... :)<br/>
<br/>
I think it is too late for the Kumeyaay box I placed down in San Diego county back in August.  It is near the area where the biggest fire is burning.  I have heard that Descanso (not Descanso Gardens but the town of Descanso down by San Diego) was evacuated.  The town of Cuyamaca was completely destroyed.  The box was planted between Cuyamaca and Descanso so I am pretty sure it is gone.<br/>

 I am 99.9% certain that the two boxes we placed in the Lake Arrowhead/San<br/>
Bernardino mountains are gone. Monday I saw the tree one was hidden under<br/>

location in the fire zones. By our calculations, several of the Arrowhead<br/>
boxes not planted by us should still be alright - and hopefully my saying<br/>

well.<br/>

  We'd found three of them before and while Rim of the World Drive is<br/>
probably gone based on our maps, Rock Camp should be fine and we can't<br/>
decide on Lake Arrowhead Overlook - we've seen reporters standing in that<br/>
location and it was fine, but haven't seen anyone there since yesterday<br/>
afternoon. And some of the others are more towards the Hesperia side of the<br/>
lake, which has fared better thus far.<br/>

<br/>
As of this morning, people were starting to evacuate Hesperia and 300 homes were burned on the north side of Lake Arrowhead.  This thing is just burning out of control.  At the rate things are going, the San Bernadino mountains may nothing but dirt and rock before this is over.<br/>
<br/>
The onshore winds may be bringing in moisture but they are having the same effect as the Santa Anas but they are blowing the fires in the direction they hadn't been going previously.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard a lot of reporters giving their opinions about when and where the fires will stop but I think there is no way of knowing until they actually go out.  There is just too much fuel out there because of the bark beetles killing trees and the fact that some of these areas haven't burned in over 100 years.<br/>

I think we So.Cal-ers should think about a phoenix series.  We could <br/>
each contribute a carving--our own version of a phoenix--and then see <br/>
about planting them in some of the cities affected by the fires as <br/>
they recover.<br/>
<br/>
Even more care than usual would have to be taken to plant the boxes <br/>
in areas where foot traffic wouldn't harm the environment (i.e., <br/>
contribute to erosion) and after a sufficient period of time so as <br/>
not add traffic that would be burdensome to those rebuilding.  <br/>
<br/>
Many of the fire areas are heavily dependent on tourism (Julian, Lake <br/>
Arrowhead, and Big Bear come to mind).  I know many businesses in Big <br/>
Bear were already suffering because the lake has been so low in the <br/>
summer the past few years and the skiing hasn't been much to write <br/>
home about, either. For them to lose the business of many year-round <br/>
residents as well as that of the tourists will kill many a small <br/>
business.  A few of our tourist dollars up there wouldn't hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts, anyone?<br/>

I know after our fire we were in a state of shock for quite a while, and we didn't lose any structure only 80 trees. We really didn't appreciate looky loos and it took us a while to get over the loss. Unless you go through a forest fire you do not have any idea what trauma it causes, at least we had no clue until we experienced it. Placing letterboxes at a fire scene may not be received well even though your intentions are good and I'm not sure we could generate enough tourist dollars to make a difference.<br/>

  about planting them in some of the cities affected by the fires as <br/>
  they recover.<br/>
<br/>
  Even more care than usual would have to be taken to plant the boxes <br/>
  in areas where foot traffic wouldn't harm the environment (i.e., <br/>
  contribute to erosion) and after a sufficient period of time so as <br/>
  not add traffic that would be burdensome to those rebuilding.  <br/>
<br/>
  Many of the fire areas are heavily dependent on tourism (Julian, Lake <br/>
  Arrowhead, and Big Bear come to mind).  I know many businesses in Big <br/>
  Bear were already suffering because the lake has been so low in the <br/>
  summer the past few years and the skiing hasn't been much to write <br/>
  home about, either. For them to lose the business of many year-round <br/>
  residents as well as that of the tourists will kill many a small <br/>
  business.  A few of our tourist dollars up there wouldn't hurt.<br/>
<br/>
  Thoughts, anyone?<br/>

<br/>
Wow!  That is a really cool idea!  I love it!  I'll try and carve one this <br/>
weekend!<br/>

Exactly.  I realize no offense was intended and none was taken, but I <br/>
believe you've misunderstood what I was proposing. Remember, I added <br/>
the following caveat:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My folks have a timeshare in Big Bear.  We usually go up at least at <br/>
Thanksgiving and for spring break every year.  Obviously, we won't be <br/>
going up this month and, depending on what happens, our annual spring <br/>
visit may be out of the question, as well, but we WILL be go back <br/>
eventually if the building is still standing--or when they rebuild <br/>
it, whichever is the case.<br/>
<br/>
You're right about looky loos.  Those poor folks up there don't need <br/>
sightseers coming up to see the burn or to plant letterboxes right <br/>
now--and I wasn't proposing that at all.  However, whatever the <br/>
immediate fate of Big Bear and the other areas, the folks there will <br/>
eventually rebuild.  I understand the folks in Ventura are already <br/>
clamoring to get their slabs bulldozed so they can get the process <br/>
started. As the folks in the burn areas start trying to get back to <br/>
some sense of normalcy, they are going to need visitors to get their <br/>
economies back on track although it will obviously be a while before <br/>
they get to that point. <br/>
<br/>
This horrible disaster is touching us all, in one way or another. I <br/>
think the phoenix image would be an appropriate tribute, provided the <br/>
time and location are chosen carefully. <br/>

That sounds like a great idea! We have recently had fires up here, <br/>
too. Cuesta Grade and the area between Santa Maria and Buellton have <br/>
each seen fire of late. Perhaps we can also do some tree planting <br/>
locally around the SLO/Santa Maria area. <br/>
<br/>
This would have to be with the property manager's okay, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Sending some rain down your way. We are finally getting it here at <br/>
Avila Beach today. <br/>

Our prayers and thoughts are with you down there,<br/>

Thanks!  We are looking forward to the rain.  The weather report this morning said that the mountain areas where the fires are burning may get as much as 6" of snow tonight.<br/>
<br/>
The bad news is that rain later on in the season is going to cause all sorts of mudslides and flooding since there is no longer any vegetation to hold the soil in place on a large portion of the southern slopes of the Angeles and San Bernadino mountains.  <sigh>  Southern California is in for an exciting year.  :(<br/>
