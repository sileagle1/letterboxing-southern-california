Yes, I owe you all the five boxes I was readying for Plant a Letterbox Day, now a month past-due, and I do hope to get those planted this week.  We'll see...<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I'd still like to challenge y'all to find places and plant boxes here in the eastern San Gabriel Valley. <br/>

Thanks for considering it!<br/>

Many times letterboxers will go to an area for a few finds and leave a little something behind.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, Don... as soon as my back is better (it went "out" today, cumulative thanks to a 3-week cough)!  All my series needed was one logbook, and I found three correct-sized (I think) recycled product notebooks at Target for $1.29 each!  <br/>
<br/>
So... as soon as my back allows, I'll have my kids help me get the boxes planted.  (I'd hoped to do it before they got out of school, so they could follow the clues themselves, and find the boxes themselves.)<br/>
<br/>
They can plan their own... my 11-year-old has some ideas already!<br/>
