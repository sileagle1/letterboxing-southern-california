We cast our vote for Fri afternoon-eve for meeting Nephew Wassa, etc.<br/>
If the vote is for Thurs, we would be arriving after 7-7:30 as I have swim class, which the body needs.   Has a location been arranged?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The meet is going to be Friday.  I will post it soon.  I don't actually have a place in mind.  Any suggestions?  My plan is to probably hang with Wassa in the afternoon and do some boxing.  I welcome anyone to join us.  And then meet up for dinner.  I asked him if there were any boxes he would like to go after and he left it up to me!  So many choices.  Anyway, what do you all think?  Either a place to find one good box?  Or maybe somewhere with a few of them.  I don't care.  Suggestions?  And then I figure we could meet up somewhere near there for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Please help me figure out a place!!! <br/>

Thanks :-)<br/>
