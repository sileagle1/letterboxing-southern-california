I'll check out a couple of  dinner places today for prices :  Busters, Lone Star and another.  It would be good to know how many folks are coming;......10-12? Reservations will be necessary due to 4th of July weekend.  <br>
 I'll post again with my searching results.  Don't worry Lil Nephew,  I'll do my best.<br>
<br>
For those boxing in our area check out Orange County boxes in Seal Beach and Huntington Beach.  In L.A. county print clues for Kelsungs boxes and ours in Long Beach and other boxers contributions too i.e. Marina Pacific Plumbing problem, Moon Jellies   These and others could keep folks busy for several hours in some can start boxing in early afternoon,  Back later.    Gwen/Don<br>
