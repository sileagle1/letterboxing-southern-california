SOOOOO, I would like your imput, Riverbeach with sunset view or O'Malleys with booze.   I'll post directions on Friday morning to the restaurant that gets the most response.  <br>

Friends, I've been dragging myself through a few eateries in Seal Beach<br>
and have come up with 2 workable places.<br>
O'Malleys on Main Street (100 block). A pub with liquor ,bangers and<br>
mash and lots of conventional choices. $12-18 range.<br>
The other place is at the foot of First Street in Seal Beach and very<br>
much on the BEACH, called Riverbeach. It could be a bit chilly, outside<br>
and inside dining and no liquor ( I think) and in the same price range<br>
as above. They have a nice variety of chow, from Mexican to American.<br>
Pay parking and very casual atmosphere<br>
<br>
I made reservations at O'Malleys for 7:PM Friday night but I'm not<br>
locked into either spot. Riverbeach would not take reservations but said<br>
their dinner time service is not too busy.<br>
<br>
SOOOOO, I would like your imput, Riverbeach with sunset view or<br>
O'Malleys with booze. I'll post directions on Friday morning to the<br>
restaurant that gets the most response. <br>

Thanks so much for setting this up Gwen.  Nothing like basically getting volunteered to set up a gathering (sheepish grin)<br>
