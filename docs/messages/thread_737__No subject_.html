<br>
I'm not sure when I will be there next as it is difficult to travel with 3 small kids. Hopefully it won't be too long. One of our NC letterboxers is moving to Edwards AFB, so take good care of her you hear? <br>

<br>
Also, any of the other times I have attempted a hike and shorter ones at that, I have literally had to use a walker for a day or two after wards - AND as bad as my ankle and heel were hurting, I just knew I was going to be stuck using it for at least a week - GUESS WHAT??? It hurt like heck the next morning, but I was able to walk unassisted!!<br>
That might not mean much to you all, but it's close to a miracle for me :-)<br>
WOO HOO!!<br>
Now, do I want to do another hike like that this weekend - No way !! ha ha<br>
<br>
Now, I got to really looking at my clues for the tunnel - did anybody see what I saw? Check out#4, especially the part in ( )<br>
<br>
Also, #3 has an interesting line about "hugging" - you can't hug something from way above, but you can throw your arm over someones shoulder and give them a squeeze - just sayin' ??????<br>
<br>
Remember, this was planted in 2003 - things grow in nine years - even on my side of the hill.<br>
