Honest, there are no hidden clues!<br>
<br>
My Bro-in-law passed away over two years ago. Recently my sister asked me to dispose of his firearms which I have already done, but she also asked me to sell his Lionel train collection.<br>
<br>
This I have no experience in as my only connection with Lionel trains was when I was a wee lad. <br>
<br>
Yes I realize I could try to sell on EBay, but frankly I'm not interested in doing that. If there is anyone out there that knows about Lionel Trains, or can tell me where to go (no smart allecky type responses with this opening)please contact me off list. She lives in Mission Viejo so I do not have physical,immediate access to the stuff, but I do have a list of the stuff available.<br>
