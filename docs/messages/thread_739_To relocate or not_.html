                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was checking on my boxes today, and doing some planning for expansion when I came to the only box that has yet to be found, Rodeo Time. The box had obviously been found because the location was slightly different from where I had placed it. Also, all the items inside the bag were in a different order from where I had originally placed them. I was very grateful that the finder returned the box, though a bit concerned that an apparent muggle had already discovered the box. I was contemplating a new hiding spot and looking for other places to hide boxes because I want to turn this box into a series, and I came across a geocache. It was not more than 15 feet from my box. I think that perhaps a geocacher might have been looking for the other box and run across mine.<br>
Now, here is the question. Do you think I should relocate this box? If it was muggled, that would mean that it was such an obvious spot that it was found by muggles within two weeks of hiding it. If, as I suspect, it was a geocacher trying to find the cache I found, then I might not have to worry about it. This is my favorite stamp so far (except for my personal traveler), but I really love the location where it is. What do you think? Relocate, or no?<br>

I'll definitely back L & N up on that point.  You likely had a cacher who knows of letterboxing and was polite.  Many cachers are unaware of our hobby, and might think your box is the cache, so take your stamp thinking it's a trade item.  Therefore, relocate or you risk losing your favorite stamp.<br>
<br>
I actually signed up to the geocaching site a while ago, just so I could double-check before I put out new plants that I'm not treading too closely.<br>

Thanks, That was what I was thinking too. The geocache was empty and unsigned too, so I know that it was new or recently replaced. If that is the case, I should think that many more cachers will go looking for it. <br>
Thanks everyone. <br>
