<br/>
Shall I keep you all in suspense??? No, Don and Gwen already met me.<br/>
<br/>
My real name is Lois...and I got the letterbox fever bad....I even dream of it at night....I can't get it out of my mind...help Lord! It's controlling me AAARRRGHHH! lol<br/>
<br/>
I first heard about it from a homeschooling yahoo group and started my own investigation... My first find was Venus de Lakewood (at least something good came out of that statue!) The find was so fun and the stamp so amazing.. I caught the bug!<br/>
<br/>
Now I've spend over $100 on supplies and I've tried almost every kind of material. I've finally found my love......the pink stuff!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Don and Gwen for all your encouragement...I can't wait to try narrowing the #1 nib.<br/>
<br/>
So that's me....a homeschooling mom....who happens to live near Kelsung..  Kelsung...I'm going to ride my bicycle down your street and call your name for you to come out and play..... lol<br/>
<br/>
Why haven't you found my plants yet?? I hear one is across from your house... I'm offended..... you're supposed to be a legend...<br/>
<br/>
As to the reason my plants disappeared off atlas quest for a while...I had a perimenopausal meltdown....I thought... "letterboxing is consuming me I must reduce reduce reduce.....keep it contained....one website only please....but alas I gave in.... I can't keep away....there's too many features besides...<br/>
<br/>
So that's my story...thanks guys for all the plants...my favorites have included the Big Dog series by Lee and Nancy...those stamps are out of this world!!! and what I aspire to...<br/>

I actually did dream about letterboxing last night. lol I am planting a few series and I spent the night planning, whether I wanted to or not. lol. <br/>

I just spent about $10 trying to make fake rocks out of insulation, and they turned out looking more like poop. lol Still haven't found my carving medium, but I'm trying some new ones soon. <br/>

Its so addicting, isn't it!?!  I haven't been in quite a while now, but still every time I travel I try to convince my husband to let me get a few boxes.  I just wish I could get him "bitten" with the "bug"...any ideas on how to convince a 30-something sports nut that his life NEEDS boxing? :P <br/>

I'm a legend afflicted with the same fever.  However, loss of a job and potential foreclosure tends to distract.<br/>
<br/>
This week I've begun a barrage of maintenance and replacements on my plants.  Once I'm comfortable they're up to snuff again, I should be back to hunting.  On that note, tonight I got three oldie-but-goodies back out:  The Triangle, Flower, and Luggage.  All of them have actually been ready for months, except for the bonus box clues that died with my hard-drive.  I officially decided to give up on that, when I found the Dragon box had also run out of its supply.  On top of all that, I had a recent report that the bonus box logbook in fact got water damaged after almost four years.  The stamp is still fine for any who still might make the trip.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, fellow newbie Dafamily is in fact my sister-in-law, who has already been taking my far-less-active-boxer wife, Zuhl is Cool, out for a few of yours.<br/>

I'm sure we'll meet face-to-face soon enough,<br/>

<br/>
I'm sure she'll jump on me for calling her a newbie, since she has in fact been boxing just a couple months less than I have, but she fell off the wagon for a quite a while, only to recently show signs of a new outbreak of the fever.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Since I'm married to her sister, she's certainly called me worse names, so I'll still call her a newbie.  If your F count after 4 years is still under 50, you're a newbie.  :)<br/>

Hey, my F count would be much bigger if I could log all those ones I found with you two over the years. Like when I, trooper I am, went boxing with you two just days (or was it day?) after surgery. :-p  <br/>
<br/>
Not to mention I do live in a boxing light area. I am saving the last two that I haven't gotten in the area for a special occasion.If there were more boxes out here to find I would happily find more, but alas no luck with that. Maybe Kelsung can plant one when he comes to find all my plants. (hint, hint.)<br/>
<br/>
I AM bitten though. Being in a boxing light area has given me the love of planting, and anyone that makes the trip in a week or two will have a very full day looking for my finds. (I have some new things in the planning for next week, including a completely new type of box I'm calling a collaboration box). The truth is I am infatuated with finding boxes, but I love planting boxes (much as, I suspect, Golden Gecko is). I just hope I don't run out of interesting spots to plant in.<br/>

Marino's has domestics and Italian beers.  Johnny Rebs' has domestics and micro-brews from the South.  So, yes, sweetheart, you can get a Bud and lose another belt.<br/>

There were many a wild goose we chased, but we found a lot of great boxes. My favorite was Lobo, even though you made me take him off my find list. :-P<br/>
Anyhow, we will be down from the 15th and we are staying for the weekend. We can plan something for then if you would like.<br/>
Dafamily.<br/>
BTW- That does NOT get you out of finding my boxes, mister, so don't think it does! lol<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey, my F count would be much bigger if I could log all those ones I found with you two over the years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's why I gave you an estimate of 50.  ;p<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But, yeah, the truth is I would have never found "Little West Wetlands" without you.  We chased many a wild goose that afternoon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe Kelsung can plant one when he comes to find all my plants. (hint, hint.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gee, the thought hadn't even begun to speculate the possibility of contemplating perhaps crossing my mind....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And the next time YOU'RE down THIS way, I thought we'd hit up the Gecko for lunch at Marino's or Johnny Rebs' - and see who else shows up.<br/>

Okay, so I got Dafamily (2), Tdyans, Piper Paws, Maule/Tony/Atlas (2.5), me and maybe Zuhl is Cool (she may be working).  That's 8.  Anybody else?  Let me know ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
I made a reservation for 15 at Johnny Rebs' for 1pm.  They have a screened in front area they call the "porch" which would be great, but they also have a gated area outside on the sidewalk, so I think Atlas would be okay either way.  I created an event on AQ:<br/>

Why, yes of course, eating BBQ is sooo exhausting!  It's a tough job but somebody's got to do it.   ;-)<br/>
I may have a conflict that day but if not I'd love to come by and help you all with this difficult endeavor. Anything for the cause of Letterboxing!  My 1/2 is 14, and since that's like, 98 in people years he'll be home in the air conditioning.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Anyhow, we will be down from the 15th and we are staying for the weekend. We can plan something for then if you would like.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Wed, July 15th thru Sun, July 19th??? I smell a mini-meet! I know we just had one in Seal Beach, but I missed it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Since I used to work at Johnny Rebs' I was thinking we could make a reservation for the front porch on, say, Saturday afternoon and I might even get them to give us a couple free appetizers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   www.johnnyrebs.com<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Who's in?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Or, like I said, I love Marino's, too. They're a little cheaper, and messy BBQ might not be good while stamping exchanges. :)<br/>

The place has a really cool atmosphere, crazy southern decor everywhere, and the bathrooms have barnyard sounds so that you feel like you're in the outhouse behind the barn, which kids always get a kick out of.<br/>
<br/>
And the music is really good (I should know, I put together the playlists)!<br/>

&gt; Okay, so I haven't quite learned how to follow the thread on this website :). Is the (as of now) decided date and place on Saturday, July 18 at Johnny Rebs (where is there one in Bellflower?)? And what time would it be at? We may likely be in if that is the case.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I should start a new thread to respond, just to make it more confusing ;)<br/>

What a cruel thing to say Kelsung. ;-p<br/>
No, really, your count doesn't matter, the world gets in the way sometimes and we can't all be obsessed all the time. I think that the fact that you take your kids out with you is awesome. I have found that it is one pastime that the whole family can enjoy, regardless of age. <br/>
Dafamily says: You're awesome just because you box. <br/>
