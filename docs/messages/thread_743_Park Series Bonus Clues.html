Thankyouthankyouthankyou!!!!!!!<br/>

Ooops!  Did I just publicly reveal something about a mystery bonus box?  BTW, it's only had 3 finds in 4 years, and two of them are relatives I coaxed.  Yeah, it wasn't supposed to be for the average boxer.<br/>
<br/>
So now I have to scrap the plans I'd been making to put something new in those boxes.  But don't worry, it's just going to have to go somewhere else now.<br/>
