We'll be in Wrightwood on the 18th for a 2pm birthday party -- kinda close to Victorville.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Anyhow, we will be down from the 15th and we are staying for the weekend. We can plan something for then if you would like.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Wed, July 15th thru Sun, July 19th??? I smell a mini-meet! I know we just had one in Seal Beach, but I missed it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Since I used to work at Johnny Rebs' I was thinking we could make a reservation for the front porch on, say, Saturday afternoon and I might even get them to give us a couple free appetizers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   www.johnnyrebs.com<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Who's in?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Or, like I said, I love Marino's, too. They're a little cheaper, and messy BBQ might not be good while stamping exchanges. :)<br/>

Sadly, no.  I'm referring to the one here in Bellfower that is local to myself and Golden Gecko.<br/>
<br/>
More sadly, several of you jumped on the idea, but GG herself is unavailable.  :(<br/>
