The box wasn't very far at all, just our usual trip to the restroom.<br>
We were able to get hubby brother involved with his family, they got all excited and are now trying to figure out there LB trail name.<br>
We were able to get something like 6 boxes while there.  Tons of muggles so it took a long time to get it done.  With 10 peaple it took all day long.  Trying to teach them to be stealthy, explain about buying or making stamps, books etc.  <br>
But it was a wonderful vacation, something we haven't done in years.<br>
<br>
BTW I saw Dons stamp in the book!!!!!Pretty cool (Sorry am stumped on Dons wifes name, I know they work the books together, if I'm totally off base just let me know)<br>
<br>
We were also in Virginia City and Carson City NV.  But did not have time to get any boxes there sadly.<br>

<br>
Hmmmm, a Don stamp??? Well I have one but usually it gets stamped along with our Don & Gwen stamp. Doesn't sound like you found our "Got Deet" series so maybe next time. That one has a collection of hideous stamps.<br>
<br>
Here is a heads up for anyone reading this note as well as the mini meet posts.....don't bother thinking whether or not to go to Johnny Rebs.....just sign up and go!!!!!<br>
<br>
Mini meets are the best part of Letterboxing! <br>
<br>
We would be there ourselves except we have prior committments.<br>
<br>
To all of the attendees, have fun but keep Geogeorgia sober.<br>
<br>
Don<br>

You and Gwen had stamped in someone's book either the Camp Richardson, or Day at Vahalla.  That's where I seen it.  <br>
We will probably go back again next summer and will make your Got Deet a must.  You definately need Deet anywhere around there lol.  Although we survived that bugs and the bears.<br>
<br>
Sorry I couldn't remember Gwens name (still new at this or atleast I like to think so)<br>
<br>
What is happening and where is Johnny Rebs?  Is this the Seal Beach gathering?<br>
