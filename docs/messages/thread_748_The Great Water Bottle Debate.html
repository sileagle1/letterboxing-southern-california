P.S.  Nalgene makes plastic bottles.  They *do* carry a line of stainless steel bottles, which are designed and made by Guyot Designs.  Nalgene's website is very clear that these are made in China, so I don't understand your ire.<br/>

The phrase "Made in USA" on the plastic bottles is *not* part of the logo; the Nalgene logo is the same on both lines of products.  On the stainless steel bottles, it clearly states "by Guyot Designs" below the logo.  There is absolutely, positively nothing nefarious or misleading about this.  This is exactly what the Truth in Advertising laws call for: the plastic bottles made by Nalgene are made in the USA and they state that fact; the stainless ones are not so made, so there is no claim to that.  If less-discerning people are "fooled", it is by their own inability to make a critical distinction, not by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc, the parent of Nalgene, deliberately being misleading.  This is why Logic and Rhetoric were taught in schools 100 years ago; to give people the tools to make these distictions.  In the recent rush to teach "facts", most people have lost the ability (or never acquired it) to know what to do with them :-(  <br/>
<br/>
Now, there is certainly a small criticism that can be made about their website; they use a standard frame on almost every page, which includes the Nalgene logo and "Made in USA" in the upper left-hand corner; this has not been altered on the pages that have the stainless steel bottles.  I would call this a design flub, rather than a misleading statement, as the "Made in China" statement is below the picture of the bottles.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom Line: those who can't (or worse, won't) think deserve to be fooled.  And the vast majority of election results over the past 20 years or so point out how few people are willing, let alone able, to think.  In this case, I think you just mistook a statement that applies to a specific object, or a group of them, and tried to apply it to the entire class of objects.  That is not proper Logic, and now you know.  You can continue to buy and use Nalgene bottles without guilt or shame (you don't have to buy the stainless steel ones, of course), and should anyone make the same logical error that you made, you'll be able to correct them :-)<br/>

<br/>
If you go to Nalgene's store website it clearly says "Nalgene, made in USA" and there is a picture on the right hand side of a stainless steel water botle.  Nowhere here does it say "made in China".  Click on the stainless steel bottle and two bottles come up.  Nowhere here does it say "made in China" or that this product comes from a different manufacturer.  In fact, what I do see is "made in USA" and "genuine nalgene. ask for it by name."  Additionaly, at this point I can directly add the product to my cart without finding out additional product information.  Now, I agree that most people wouldn't do that, but when you do click on the product, you still can't see the guyot design name on the bottle.  You can read about it below and it says "Stainless by Guyot Designs. A Nalgene bottle..." and below that "Made in China".  First, if it is a Nalgene bottle then by the design of their own website, I am under the impression that it is made in the USA.  For me, someone who shops primarily online, I have been misled.  I go to a website touting on every page "made in USA", dig down to the product I want and find out, oops, no this isn't made in the USA.  Regardless of my ability to find this out (as Maule clearly did) or the intent by Thermo Fisher Scientific to mislead, it is in fact misleading.  <br/>
<br/>
Definition of misleading according to thefreedictionary.com "giving a false or confusing impression" and "designed to deceive or mislead either deliberately or inadvertently"<br/>
<br/>
Just because we are smart enough to discern the truth doesn't mean it is not misleading or that we shouldn't point out this fact to the manufacturer however we choose to do so.<br/>

<br/>
Let me just say this, as my envoi on this issue.  I have already given my thoughts on the minor website flub, i.e. the use of the same frame for every sub-page.  That this is a common practice does not mean that it is proper in every case.  I grant that point.  But to call the entire company *deliberately* misleading is, IMUO, unfair.  Yes, there is nothing wrong with pointing out that the website could be better designed.  Show me a website that is perfect!  But the accusations leveled against Nalgene are disproportionate to the actual offense.  You are perfectly within your rights to refuse to buy their products.  I just think that the opprobrium displayed herein has been overdone.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; And therein lies both the problem and the solution.  The stainless steel bottles do *not* state "Made in USA" on them.  The phrase "Made in USA" on the plastic bottles is *not* part of the logo; the Nalgene logo is the same on both lines of products.  On the stainless steel bottles, it clearly states "by Guyot Designs" below the logo.  There is absolutely, positively nothing nefarious or misleading about this.  This is exactly what the Truth in Advertising laws call for: the plastic bottles made by Nalgene are made in the USA and they state that fact; the stainless ones are not so made, so there is no claim to that.  If less-discerning people are "fooled", it is by their own inability to make a critical distinction, not by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc, the parent of Nalgene, deliberately being misleading.  This is why Logic and Rhetoric were taught in schools 100 years ago; to give people the tools to make these distictions.  In the recent rush to teach "facts", most people have lost the ability (or never acquired it) to know what to do with them :-(  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now, there is certainly a small criticism that can be made about their website; they use a standard frame on almost every page, which includes the Nalgene logo and "Made in USA" in the upper left-hand corner; this has not been altered on the pages that have the stainless steel bottles.  I would call this a design flub, rather than a misleading statement, as the "Made in China" statement is below the picture of the bottles.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Bottom Line: those who can't (or worse, won't) think deserve to be fooled.  And the vast majority of election results over the past 20 years or so point out how few people are willing, let alone able, to think.  In this case, I think you just mistook a statement that applies to a specific object, or a group of them, and tried to apply it to the entire class of objects.  That is not proper Logic, and now you know.  You can continue to buy and use Nalgene bottles without guilt or shame (you don't have to buy the stainless steel ones, of course), and should anyone make the same logical error that you made, you'll be able to correct them :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; My ire lies in the fact that Nalgene claims "Made in USA" directly under their logo, but sells products that tout their name which are made in China.  For the less discerning consumer, it appears that all their products are made in the US.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I tried to read it, but thin black letters on dark red is *NOT* something that's easy on the eyes, especially older ones that need glasses, and which prescription is changed almost every year :-(  PLEASE change the background color!!  Thank you.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P.S.  Nalgene makes plastic bottles.  They *do* carry a line of stainless steel bottles, which are designed and made by Guyot Designs.  Nalgene's website is very clear that these are made in China, so I don't understand your ire.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did it.  I started a blog.  Read about my anger over Nalgene and their false claims.<br/>
