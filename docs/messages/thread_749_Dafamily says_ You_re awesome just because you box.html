Be careful out there.  We just got back from Tahoe.  Not sure how the bears are in Wrightwood but be sure and take a whistle or a air horn lol.  We had 2 incounters in 2 days.  I know there's a big difference in forests but geez all my life I've camped and never had an encounter like the one we had.  We weren't the only one's with bears in our camp.  There were sighting all over the grounds, and horns honking everywhere.  Day or night!  Be careful and have fun!<br/>
