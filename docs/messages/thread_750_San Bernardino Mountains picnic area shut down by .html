                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just found this in my mail, from ABC 7 news.  We didn't put food out but the littlest bit even deoderant and toothpaste they say to put in the bear boxes.  Some guy accidentally left a 2 liter soda out.  People in the camp told me they watched the bear come out, grab the bottle, go up the hill a ways, sit down, popped a hole in it, it sprayed a bit, than he downed it.  <br/>
I think it's not just those that are feeding the bears but it's the people converging on their grounds.  I love bears, it's one of my handles, and my trail stamp, but when you are that close to a black bear and it does not want to leave your camp, where you have 6 kids sleeping in tents and a trailer well it's frightening.  They say girlscouts is the biggest problem because the girls always want to take food or candy into their tent.  <br/>
I know you all probably know all this and I did too, I knew to keep things locked up but the bears know all about the bear boxes where you store your food.  They can smell the food in them and come down a knocking.  I have pictures of the bear paws on the ground around the box and on the box.  The bear had to be 3 1/2 ft tall on all fours.  It was a beautiful site though.  It was a black bear but actually had fur of the blonde color.  Hubby said I was saying "what do we do, where's the camera, hun, hun, he's coming closer, where's the camera". lol  Than when it got too close hubby started whistling, me, than his brother started yelling at it, than the one kid in the tent I gave a whistle too started blowing, etc.  What seemed like forever was probably a good 4 to 5 min long encounter.<br/>

Anyway see below for the news on the picnic area close in the S.B. mountains.<br/>

The U.S. Forest Service closed the picnic area and some hiking trails in Forest Falls. <br/>

They're concerned a bear has become very pushy in getting people's food. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Heather.  I'll share this with my Wrightwood friends, too.  Often, when we can't get a reservation at a beach campground, we camp instead at Serrano, in Big Bear.  This year, we're doing neither.  Our day in Wrightwood will be spent at our friends' house -- but with all the kids out and about, we'll keep an eye out for bears nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again --  Thankful that the Lord kept you safe in your bear encounter!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
