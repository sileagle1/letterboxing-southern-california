I started looking at dates for a Griffith Park gathering in November and want to get some feedback on what date would be best for everyone.  <br>
<br>
My first choice would be Saturday, Nov 14.  <br>
<br>
Other options:<br>
Nov 7, 8, 15, 21, or 22.<br>

I am, how shall I put this, a low-key event planner.  I am not going to plan any activities other than just plain ol' boxing.  So, if anybody has the desire to take something on... teach/plan a class, kid's activities, etc., then go for it!  Just keep me posted.<br>
<br>
It was great seeing you yesterday and everybody else who came too!<br>

Datewise, my only preference is for Saturday over Sunday.  Other than that, I think any of those weekends is fine with me.<br>

That said, Nov. 21 won't be good for us, as <br>
it's the date set for Skater Chick & Little Puppy's<br>
birthday party.  (aka: the Hansenclan kids)<br>

I would love to come and meet you all while doing the best hobby ever.  I can come the 7th, 8th, and 15th (though I like the 7th or 8th best).  I would be happy to help.  <br>
<br>
This will be my first BIG gathering so I don't know the etiquette... does anyone plant a box? I read about cooties and personal travelers... does this group do those too?  Anything a newbie should know?<br>
<br>
Thanks,  Wendy (a.k.a. Love to Carve)<br>

Based on the dates people can't come, I think November 7th will be the best choice.  I will post something on Atlas Quest.<br>
<br>
As for planting, I would like to get together before hand and plant.  The problem is the weekend before is Halloween, my favorite holiday!  So I will definitely not be available the Saturday before.  I would be good for Sunday though.  I am also thinking of going the day before to do some planting.  Anyone can carve, anyone can plant.  The main thing will be if you don't get me clues ahead of time, you will need to distribute the clues yourselves.  Ok, I am going to stop rambling.<br>
<br>
Cooties, Personal Travelers will be part of the gathering.  Both are up to you how much you want to participate.  I am suer you will be indoctrinated quickly!<br>
<br>
Ok, I will post the event and let you all know.<br>

Awesome!  Did you have any idea where in Griffith the gathering will be?  The Old Zoo Picnic Area?  Or did you have someplace else in mind?<br>

A few people have said they might be up for going to check out spots with me.  I am not sure when I can go right now. My brother-in-law and his wife and two kids arrive from Italy today and will be with us until September 5, so my schedule is pretty locked up for the next few weeks.  I could go Sept 6, but people might be out of town.  I could also go Sept 12 or 13.<br>

A few people have said they might be up for going to check out spots with me.  I am not sure when I can go right now. My brother-in-law and his wife and two kids arrive from Italy today and will be with us until September 5, so my schedule is pretty locked up for the next few weeks.  I could go Sept 6, but people might be out of town.  I could also go Sept 12 or 13.<br>

As far as I know Piper Paws is not changing the date (Nov 7th).  She is wanting to go early to pick out a good picnic area and firm up the plans.  I just got rid of visiting relatives myself, and plan to be at Griffith in the mid to late afternoon on the 12th.  I need to check on my Carousal box that was reported missing, and to scope out where I might plant a series or two for the event.<br>

I offered since I plan to be coming back from Long Beach that afternoon (12th), and had to check on one of my boxes anyway.  I also hope to get a Banana Nut Muffin while I am out.<br>

GeoG - time permitting, I will try to check on your Dream Lovers box.  Unless you get a bunch of other volunteers in the meantime.<br>

We were veryfortunate that the firemen were able to keep it at bay and it never got into our forest on this "side" of the mountains. <br>
We did have some scary moments(it's still lurking out there),and I still have a friends horse in my back yard - that they had to walk for five miles in the wee hours of the morning - after getting the mandatory evac. notice. <br>
Poor old thing was too scared to get in a neighbors trailer because of all the smoke and strangers.<br>
We've had crews here from all over the south land as well as AZ and NM - amazing to watch. <br>
Watchingthe bombers and their spotter plane doing intricate manuevers over the ridge was pretty awesome as well - <br>
<br>
when I worked for the USFS, way back when, we did a lot of patroling around Waterman and Buckhorn, etc . . . . what a shame.<br>
When I think of the loss of wildlife as well - :-( (tears)<br>
We are blessed to have our home, and our hearts go out to all who lost theirs.<br>

Here's a good map...<br>
http://angeles.sierraclub.org/griffith/griffith_park_map.html<br>
<br>
Why don't we meet in the parking lot just South of the Merry-Go-Round?  Unless someone has a better suggestion.<br>
<br>
Also, take a look at the map and consider potential locations.  We should look at The Old Zoo Picnic Area, The Mineral Wells Picnic Area, the area near Fern Dell.  We could check out the area up Canyon Drive.<br>

If you don't have my cell phone number, send me an email here or on AQ and I will send it to you.<br>
