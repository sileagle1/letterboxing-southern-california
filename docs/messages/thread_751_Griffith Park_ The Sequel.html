I am, how shall I put this, a low-key event planner.  I am not going to plan any activities other than just plain ol' boxing.  So, if anybody has the desire to take something on... teach/plan a class, kid's activities, etc., then go for it!  Just keep me posted.<br/>

It was great seeing you yesterday and everybody else who came too!<br/>

Ironically, we will probably be at the Kern again this year, we missed the last two years because I just didn't feel like juggling the kids, dogs, &amp; baby!  <br/>
<br/>
So more than ilkely, while you're all gathering, we'll be hunting Don and Gwen boxes...<br/>

I would love to come and meet you all while doing the best hobby ever.  I can come the 7th, 8th, and 15th (though I like the 7th or 8th best).  I would be happy to help.  <br/>
<br/>
This will be my first BIG gathering so I don't know the etiquette... does anyone plant a box? I read about cooties and personal travelers... does this group do those too?  Anything a newbie should know?<br/>

Based on the dates people can't come, I think November 7th will be the best choice.  I will post something on Atlas Quest.<br/>
<br/>
As for planting, I would like to get together before hand and plant.  The problem is the weekend before is Halloween, my favorite holiday!  So I will definitely not be available the Saturday before.  I would be good for Sunday though.  I am also thinking of going the day before to do some planting.  Anyone can carve, anyone can plant.  The main thing will be if you don't get me clues ahead of time, you will need to distribute the clues yourselves.  Ok, I am going to stop rambling.<br/>
<br/>
Cooties, Personal Travelers will be part of the gathering.  Both are up to you how much you want to participate.  I am suer you will be indoctrinated quickly!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I will post the event and let you all know.<br/>

A few people have said they might be up for going to check out spots with me.  I am not sure when I can go right now. My brother-in-law and his wife and two kids arrive from Italy today and will be with us until September 5, so my schedule is pretty locked up for the next few weeks.  I could go Sept 6, but people might be out of town.  I could also go Sept 12 or 13.<br/>

As far as I know Piper Paws is not changing the date (Nov 7th).  She is wanting to go early to pick out a good picnic area and firm up the plans.  I just got rid of visiting relatives myself, and plan to be at Griffith in the mid to late afternoon on the 12th.  I need to check on my Carousal box that was reported missing, and to scope out where I might plant a series or two for the event.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; A few people have said they might be up for going to check out spots with me.  I am not sure when I can go right now. My brother-in-law and his wife and two kids arrive from Italy today and will be with us until September 5, so my schedule is pretty locked up for the next few weeks.  I could go Sept 6, but people might be out of town.  I could also go Sept 12 or 13.<br/>

We were veryfortunate that the firemen were able to keep it at bay and it never got into our forest on this "side" of the mountains. <br/>
We did have some scary moments(it's still lurking out there),and I still have a friends horse in my back yard - that they had to walk for five miles in the wee hours of the morning - after getting the mandatory evac. notice. <br/>
Poor old thing was too scared to get in a neighbors trailer because of all the smoke and strangers.<br/>
We've had crews here from all over the south land as well as AZ and NM - amazing to watch. <br/>
Watchingthe bombers and their spotter plane doing intricate manuevers over the ridge was pretty awesome as well - <br/>
<br/>
when I worked for the USFS, way back when, we did a lot of patroling around Waterman and Buckhorn, etc . . . . what a shame.<br/>
When I think of the loss of wildlife as well - :-( (tears)<br/>
We are blessed to have our home, and our hearts go out to all who lost theirs.<br/>

We were very blessed that the firemen were able to keep it at bay and it never got into our forest on this "side" of the mountains. <br/>
We did have some scary moments(it's still lurking out there)and I still have a friends horse in my back yard - that they had to walk for five miles in the wee hours of the morning - after getting the mandatory evac. notice. <br/>
Poor old thing was too scared to get in a neighbors trailer because of all the smoke and strangers.<br/>
We've had crews here from all over the south land as well as AZ and NM - amazing to watch. <br/>
Watchingthe bombers and their spotter plane doing intricate manuevers over the ridge was pretty awesome as well - <br/>
<br/>
when I worked for the USFS, way back when, we did a lot of patroling around Waterman and Buckhorn, etc . . . . what a shame.<br/>
When I think of the loss of wildlife as well - :-( (tears)<br/>
We are blessed to have our home, and our hearts go out to all who lost theirs.<br/>

The fire did make for some amazing views. <br/>
We were up at Rose Hills on Sunday, and got a view of the giant mushroom cloud while stamping in.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn't looked at the fire maps before now, but doing so, I'm now really saddened at the extent of this. The burned area is something like 20% of the entire Angeles National Forest!<br/>
And still not contained. Hiking trails up near mount waterman was really spectacular, but I suspect will be destroyed.<br/>

I'm with you on the air quality issue Tdyans! <br/>
It has been most foul up here - you can see the air - reminds me of a bad 1970's day in the LA Basin - cough cough<br/>
The saddest thing was having oak, manzanita and pine leaves/needles - burned to a crisp - landing in my yard 58 miles from the fire (which ended up moving lots closer)<br/>
You folks that go, have a great time :-)<br/>
We'll probably be at the AMX show in El Segundo<br/>

Well, if the air quality hasn't improved drastically by next weekend, it probably would be wisest for me to not come out. But it sounds like there will be more than enough helpers without me. I hate to miss any excuse for a get-together, but all this smoke has my chest feeling tight even just sitting indoors doing nothing.<br/>

&gt; I checked on you Dream Lovers box today, but as you may have noticed it was just recently found.  The box was still in good repair.  The only thing I noticed was that your reference to "Mayfair" should be changed to "Gelsons" despite what Google street view may indicate.<br/>

&gt; No, I have not had a chance to go look for your green belt yet.<br/>

&gt; I got there about 25 minutes late and couldn't find anyone who looked like a letterboxer -- whatever that's supposed to be. I was kinda looking for people with smudgy fingers running around with plastic food storage containers and waving computer printouts around and gathering rocks into suspicious-looking piles, but all I saw was folks having picnics. Oh, well -- next time!<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Here's a good map...<br/>
&gt; &gt; http://angeles. sierraclub. org/griffith/ griffith_ park_map. html<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Why don't we meet in the parking lot just South of the Merry-Go-Round?  Unless someone has a better suggestion.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, take a look at the map and consider potential locations.  We should look at The Old Zoo Picnic Area, The Mineral Wells Picnic Area, the area near Fern Dell.  We could check out the area up Canyon Drive.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WOW, sounds like everyone wants to come out and help Piper Paws pick a spot to hold the event. Between Tdyans, MrOspital, Maule, BuffaloTony, Atlas, Kelsung, and myself all helping PP, we could almost have our own mini-event.  I offered since I plan to be coming back from Long Beach that afternoon (12th), and had to check on one of my boxes anyway.  I also hope to get a Banana Nut Muffin while I am out.<br/>
