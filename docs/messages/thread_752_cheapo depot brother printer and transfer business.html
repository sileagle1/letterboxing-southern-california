from the reviews I've read, it seems to be perfect for general fast printing of transferable images and maybe a few clue sheets, though I am trying to figure out an efficient way to go paperless while boxing (for the clues, that is).<br>
<br>
I've also found a new way to do the transfer, well new to me anyways.  Before, I would use blender markers or xylol.  People also recommended acetone.  All of these I have found pretty much unacceptable.  I've found that laying the image to be transferred down and then brushing a very light coat of laquer thinner on the back transfers the image almost immediately without using a burnisher of some kind.  Before playing with thinner, I had given up doing xerox transfers, exclusively drawing and doing a pencil transfer, but now I may be back on the wagon, so to speak.  <br>
