Did you stumble across it in the wilderness? If so, how do you know it is a letterbox and not a geocache?<br>
If the clues aren't listed on any website, then you can't log it.<br>

Humbly pardoned.  If you look at the first post in this thread, you'll understand the sarcasm in the wording of his reply.<br>
<br>
Most of the boxes I plant are straightforward and for everyone.  But I like to embed deeper puzzles for those who enjoy solving them.<br>
<br>
Many of my boxes will contain some kind of bonus information inside.  You would need to collect several bonus pieces and figure out how put them together in order to get the clues to the final box.<br>

Kelsung -- does that mean that SOMEBODY has actually found all the pieces, decyphered them, and found the final box? (While I remain stuck at 13 clues collected.)  WOW.<br>

<br>
Umm... You are referring to Alphabet Soup, and yes, Bumblebeebunny found it on 3/8/09, a mere 10 days after I posted the clue.  Of course, that's because they had been gathering pieces for two months beforehand as I was sneaking them out, not yet knowing what they were for.<br>
<br>
Sand And Snow, the first finders on my Sound Guy box, which originally required you to actually come meet me at the bar I was working in at the time, were so intrigued by the string of letters inside, they focused on little else for a while and became the second finders of Alphabet Soup on 4/15/09.<br>
<br>
It has sat dormant ever since, but I know it won't be forever.  Buffalo Tony, Alarch and a few others, including you, have actively sought out quite a few pieces.<br>
<br>
But back to what THIS thread is talking about:  Since BBB found Soup so "easily" (they actually worked pretty hard to pull that off) I needed vengeance!  So, I created the Puzzle Master series.  I hoped many would be intrigued by the puzzles and seek them out, but I honestly had only one goal in mind: to stump BBB.<br>
<br>
Within six weeks, they had found eight of the nine required boxes, with a failed attempt on the ninth.  They remain the ONLY finders on three of them.  (Actually, that isn't true: all three have been stumbled upon accidentally by one noxer each, who all actually logged in and put the box back where they found it.)<br>
<br>
However, with the excuse of pregnancy (I insist upon calling it an "excuse") and "cheating" because the grandparents went and found that ninth box for them, they still took sixteen months to figure out the bonus clues and actually find the "Puzzle Master" box.<br>
<br>
Quite an accomplishment indeed.  I think both of us are satisfied:  I for coming up with such a diabolical puzzle, and they for cracking it.<br>
<br>
Of course, MrOspital will be on their heels if the light bulb ever goes off with that Bridge clue that is driving him insane.  And I Dig Toasters has been working from afar on The Heavens and $ in hopes she can find them when she visits.<br>
<br>

I realize this post has been even more self-indulgent than usual, but for anyone interested, a while back I put together a sort of "cheat-sheet" on my website:<br>

Hey! no one went and found that box for us! We strapped on our7 week old twins and slack-boxed the grandparents to the final destination! (it is true that george was the one to actually pick the box up first). We have the pictures to prove it!<br>

I will say for those who have looked at some of the Puzzle Master series, or Alphabet Soup series, but not even tried because the clues seem too hard ...give them another go!Despite Kelsung's evil taunts, his secret is that he actually does want his boxes to be found... so most of his hard clues are quite logical in their solution -- they do get a little easier once you start understanding how his mind works :)<br>

I had no idea all of Alphabet Soup was even planted yet, let alone solved a couple of times (in 2009, no less!).  Where has the time gone?<br>

Thanks,<br>

The first piece was unleashed on Jan 1, 2009:  it requires a trip downstairs with a flashlight.  But only online, not in the real world.<br>
<br>
The last was unleashed on Feb 25th, 2009:  it requires a meet & greet, which I initially thought would make it hard to come by, but probably more people now have that one than any other.<br>

Is THAT the reason for the answer to life, the universe, and everything???<br>
Such a thing never even crossed my mind.  Then again, my brain seems to be off on vacation with Dezert Ratty's (boy, did I identify with that statement!).  Three trips, and I have YET to find Matthew 7:7.  Still seeking... And one day, I shall find [it].<br>
