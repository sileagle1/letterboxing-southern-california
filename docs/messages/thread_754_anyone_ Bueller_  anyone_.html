<br>
Is there anyone out there in the SoCal area that would like to spend the day boxing, eating, more boxing and maybe more eating, laughing, walking (hence more eating for energy), lots of drinking (water of course...it's hot out there)  maybe some carving or tip giving and just in general doing a day or so of total boxing immersion?<br>
<br>
Any variations or other suggestions will be most welcome.  I travel well and can be where you are cuz it is just toooooo darned hot here in Palm Springs to think about wandering around during day light hours!<br>

Thanks!!<br>

Hmmm?  I have just hit find 498, and have been trying to decide where to go for my landmark 500.  I was thinking that Millard Falls might be a good one, but it's so hot, I wanted it to be a shorter or cooler hike.<br>
<br>
Anyone got a good idea?<br>

I guess a lot depends upon how far you guys are willing to drive.  I know of an unlisted (on LbNA and AQ, as far as I can tell) box in Matilija Canyon, above Ojai, that would make a worthy milestone box.  We found the box by accident while on a geocaching hike.  As far as we knew at the time, there were absolutely no LBs in the canyon, so I didn't have our stamp or logbook along.  Found a couple of good spots to hide boxes, but haven't had a chance to go back up there to plant them.  <br>
<br>
Problem is, that area is likely almost as hot as PS, and that's a long drive, but the hike to the box from parking isn't more than a half-mile.  There's a box or two up in Rose Valley, a few miles farther up the 33, but that'll also be very warm.  There are a few boxes closer to the beaches in Ventura, Carpinteria, etc, but I suspect that Kelsung has gotten most of them.<br>
<br>
I really need to "take advantage" of the hot weather and carve a few stamps ;-)<br>
<br>
About the only day I have free (sort of) this week is Thursday.<br>

Because if it is the one I'm thinking of, it isn't unlisted, just a little  <br>
hidden and the geocache was planted after the letterbox was in place. Oh,  <br>
and it is the 1st of a series of 4.<br>

It can be wicked hot up there and the biting flies are a major PITA. But  <br>
the coast is lovely and cool.<br>

Thanks for all the suggestions, and I'll get to them all eventually.<br>
<br>
Today was my "find 500 day" and it was great.  I met up with Pappasky from Palm Springs, along with Buffalo Tony, Maule and Atlas.  We had lunch in Altadena, then went up to Millard Falls.<br>
<br>
Thanks, D&G!  This was the perfect one to make a landmark find.  Easy level hike on rocks in a shaded canyon to a beautiful waterfall.<br>
<br>
Then the five of us went after a few others:  Eaton Canyon for another short hike, then some drive-bys.  Pappasky is a new boxer, but avid geocacher, so along the way we nabbed three caches as well.  We rounded out the evening with dinner joined by some Pasadena locals who are friends of mine.<br>
<br>
Now on to the next hunt....<br>

You should be.  Matilija Canyon is a gorgeous place but I would wait to go there in the springtime.  Things will be blooming, water will be flowing and maybe, just maybe (more than likely) you'll hear the "tortured baby" cries of the peafowl at the nature preserve.  The hike isn't terribly long but it sure is FANTASTIC.  A definite recommendation.<br>

You are welcome!<br>
<br>
Hope you reread Pandora's rant just prior to the hike. The rant actually makes the trek more interesting as then you keep on looking for all of the hazards.<br>
<br>
Hope you guys had fun at the mini gathering. We couldn't make it due to previous commitments. It was a hot/humid tiresome job but somebody had to plant the first two boxes on Lana'i.<br>

Its easy to get confused.  I believe someone recently wrote:<br>

I read that post a while back, so I just knew it was going to be an easy and pleasant hike.  I was telling the others about the post to explain all the extra information at the end of the clues.  Hysterical.<br>

<br>
For those who don't know what we're talking about, first read the original clue to this box, just the top half before the NOTE added 6/9/2003:<br>
<br>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=14767&boxname=Millard_Falls<br>
<br>
Now read Pandora's Rant (WARNING: this is a long post):<br>
<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/message/27677<br>
<br>
Now go back to the clues and read what Don added at the bottom.<br>
<br>
This couldn't be a more pleasant hike.  Now let's all stop laughing at other peoples poor judgment skills.  :)<br>

It wasn't funny at the time, and if you follow the thread you might  see that I stayed way out of the chat. I figured it was a no win situation.<br>
<br>
To Pandora's credit she later declared(a year later) that her post was over the top, and had more to do with her being a new letterboxer and not following clues properly, not wearing good hiking shoes , not carrying enough water, and not using good judgement. <br>

Hi there, I apologize for any misunderstanding my comment from last<br>
nights post may have caused.  I, in no way, found what happened to<br>
Pandora, or her sister "funny".  What I thought was funny was your<br>
comments at the end of the Clue.  I remember being chastised by you for<br>
my poor choice of footwear, after I e-mailed you in regards to how my<br>
shoes had become infested with foxtails while looking for your Pt.<br>
Vincente LB . . . .  So, your "comments" struck me as funny - Especially<br>
that late at night/early in the morning.<br>
<br>
I should have made it clear what it was I thought was funny, and that is<br>
my fault.<br>
<br>

ok, i have to comment about this one- it's just too good to not say something about...<br>
<br>
we learned from our first letterbox that you need to be prepared for anything when going on any kind of hike- small or big. you just never know. this is especially true when you are hiking during the summer. we just know that even if it is a 1/2 mile stroll in the hills, or on a trail, that we need to have the right shoes on, water, and a sense of humor. there is always the chance that we will not find the box, or that a slight incline may be a lot more challenging than we anticipated. <br>
<br>
saying that, i still have gone boxing in flip flops and lived to regret that decision.  ranting about it after such a bad experience is one thing, but geeze- hiking in the hollywood hills in the summer with 3 small bottles of water? whatever!!<br>
<br>
now we will have to go get the millard falls box- it doesn't sound that bad!!<br>
we have really enjoyed keeping up on this discussion!<br>

At the time of the "rant" there was a long discussion on whether or not to rate difficulty of hikes, clues, etc. at LbNA. I was on the side of NOT having a numerical difficulty rating system as it would be completely arbitrary and there would be so many variables that you would have to consider. At least the rant had and still has a value in its posting.<br>
