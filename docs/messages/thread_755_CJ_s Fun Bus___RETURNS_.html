We received a "Found" report just recently from BumblebeeBunny. That was pretty confusing as we knew the host wasn't there. We wrote back and BBB said she was working from an old clue sheet (we had deleted the original) and found the box on 7/19/2009.<br/>
<br/>
We trotted on over to the place and sure enough the host was back with a spiffy new paint job and the letterbox was in place. The logbook was full and along with the regular logs was a stamp (using the box stamp), and a note that said June 2, 2009, Body shop.<br/>

We left some new logbooks along with the old one and the note from the Body shop.<br/>
