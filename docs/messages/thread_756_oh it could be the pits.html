That gives me hope, then, that the stamp is the same.  However a lot can happen in 3 weeks.<br>

So this "Whatwhat" found the original (which had survived a while), dropped it, gone home, made a new stamp, a new logbook, glued magnets to the bottom of a new tupperware, went back and replanted it.... but never thought to contact us and let us know.  <br>

The longer you stay in this game the more weird stuff will happen to your creations.<br>

Now if you want a great laugh just go to Whatwhat's profile on AQ and read his/her Free Flowing Thoughts.<br>

Before you write the perp. sleep on it first.<br>

I wish I had the patience that you have.  I thought giving it the ride home, going grocery shopping and making a cocktail was long enough and I decided to, in my most diplomatic and stern voice, call him out and ask for more information.  I also pointed out that in circumstances like this, most people wouldn't be so angry if they were told outright the first time.  blah blah blah, etc etc.  We'll see if they even respond.  My hope is that they dropped only parts in the soup and retained the others, though that is farfetched.  I also hope they could tell me where they dropped it.  July and August are the times when the main pit is low on water and things just seem to sit around... we'll see.<br>
