Does anyone know of a good camping spot in or near Escondido?  We're going to the Foraych meet and greet next week, and we need a place to camp that allows dogs and tents.  Thanks for any and all suggestions!<br>

<br>
Next best (and easier) in my experience, would be to book a Kamping Kabin at the KOA in Chula Vista.  http://www.koa.com/where/ca/05112/photogallery/1.htm<br>
<br>
You bring your sleeping bags, cooler, cooking necessities -- but the cabin is there, reasonably priced, electricity and lights provided, and there's a communal kitchen across the little road between cabins, with 5-6 stoves and sinks.<br>
<br>
What I DON'T know is if Atlas would be allowed to go with you, since I haven't attempted taking our dog to the KOA.<br>
<br>
My two cents... have fun!<br>

Guajome is a nice campground.  I know they allow dogs and I THINK they allow tent camping as well.  It's technically in Oceanside, but it feels like you are in the woods.  We were just there in March, I believe.  <br>

Yup, just checked, Guajome allows tents.  Here is the link to their website. <br>
