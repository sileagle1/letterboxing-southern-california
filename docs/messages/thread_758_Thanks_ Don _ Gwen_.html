We just reached our 50th find and the great box to do it on was one in the Seal Beach Town Tour Series, which we've been savoring every last morsel of and hoping it never ends. It's so great to just decide to go out at 10 at night and be so close and with such fun boxes! Thanks, Don & Gwen!<br>

Yes, it's lame, but we get excited about numbers. So, we thought we'd post on AQ and noticed that just minutes before, someone had posted about their 400th find within their first year of boxing. Can't beat that, so here we are...Look at us! :) Sorry, lame.<br>

I think it took us 2 years to hit 50 finds.<br>
<br>
The beauty of the Seal Beach Town Tour is that night boxing is a really cool Summer time way to beat the heat in the Southland. Even during the daytime the temps are several degrees cooler in Seal Beach.<br>
<br>
We are thinking about a Hawaii box here in Seal Beach, but we haven't quite found that secure spot yet.<br>
<br>
Once you nab all of those we have in the Southland then making the trek to Kernville should be on your agenda in the Fall.<br>
