Now everyone of us can remember that first letterbox and how we felt towards our find and the special treat that the planter gave us. Sometimes you have an opportunity to meet that boxer and sometimes you do not. In our case we met the planter then she dissappeared.<br>

Well Wendy is back Letterboxing and hopefully will be joining us here on this list soon.<br>

She is an exceptional carver and we are looking forward to her plants and since she is from the old school you can be assured that she will post about her adventures.<br>

<br>
I'm giddy! Thank you Don for the intro, I hope I can live up to it.  You and Gwen have given me so many fun adventures looking for boxes.  I see that there are MANY more to hunt.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned on the LBNA list I've been lurking on the side lines for years occassionally dabbling, a hunt here a hunt there, mostly to introduce others to the fun.<br>
<br>
I'm not completely sure what it means to be from the old school but I posted my last 3 adventures (a novel... there was a very large snake involved) on the LBNA list today before I was on this list.   So do I post my adventures here too or only?<br>
<br>
Hey... I occasionally put out a temporary series of boxes in Monticeto (for a yearly rubber stamp carving retreat), anyone interested in a once a year hunt?  I can post that information on this list when it comes up if you want.  I can't remember off the top of my head but I think it is about 9 boxes you can get all in one day. YeeHa! Mark your calendars for the weekend before Thanks Giving.<br>
<br>
I'm happy to be welcomed back into the fold.<br>
<br>
Hope to meet some of you soon.<br>
<br>
Happy Hunting, Wendy (a.k.a. Love to Carve)<br>

Welcome back, Wendy.  I planted a box earlier this year that was partly in honor of you:<br>

It'd be awesome to meet you sometime,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the Welcome back and thanks for the partial honor.  I will definitely have to go looking for that box soon.<br>
<br>
Thanks also for the good adventures so far... did you arrange for the snake at the bell?  You REALLY go all the way to make for a grand adventure :-) VERY COOL!<br>
<br>
So maybe in my partial honor again there could be another SoCAL gathering.  I'm creating another set of temporary boxes in Santa Ana.  I could put them out for this group and we could have a get together around finding 4-5 boxes in a small area.  Actually it would be great if some of you could test my clues and see if they work OK before they are set out for this other event.  These would not be much of a challenge as they are designed for beginner boxers, but it would be fun and the carvings are nice.  Any takers for Sunday September 6th, early morning (8:00am) breakfast and hunting?  Let me know.<br>
<br>

My reference to "old school" was not meant as anything bad. I think if you go through many of the recent posts on the main list you will find very few "adventure reports".<br>
That part of letterboxing has changed and folks report on their adventures very seldom these days.<br>
I think that is unfortunate, so if anyone gives you any grief on the main list please realize that this SoCal list is a friendlier place and you can post all of your adventures here.<br>
<br>
I think some of the other changes to our game will surprise you, some you'll like and some you may not like.<br>
<br>
While many folks use Letterboxing.org, there are some that only use Atlas Quest (Ryan's baby). At AQ there are all sorts of bells and whistles and you have choices to use or not.<br>
<br>
At the end of all of these changes there are still clues to follow and hopefully a letterbox at the end of your journey.<br>
<br>
It is really good to have you back in the community.<br>
<br>
Don<br>

<br>
I would never think that you would be referencing me in any way but a positive... I didn't think Old School meant anything bad, I just didn't know HOW different things had become on the List.  During my recent lurking time (prior to declaring my presence on the list) I have been all through both LBNA and AtlasQuest to see the evolution/diversity of the boxes (personal travelers, cooties, etc), they sound like fun in theory.  The Atlas Quest Lists are... Holy Moly sensory overload.  I tracked one list for awhile and jumped in once without much... ah "fun" and I didn't see much in the way of reporting adventures, which you know I love.  I was also tracking LBNA, at first it seemed almost abandoned (so little traffic) and then the controversies started stirring over the question of the week which turned into the same controversy that was going on 7 years ago... it felt like HOME.  As you saw I posted my adventures and a nice woman from Wisconsin (Debbie)enjoyed reading it.  Regardless, I'm happy to be back in communication.  This SoCal list does seem to be my speed.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you and Gwen soon.<br>
<br>
Wendy (LTC)<br>

A collaboration box. It is a box where, if you choose, you can bring a small stamp of your own to add to the collaboration. It then becomes a part of the boxes stamp.<br>

I did a different kind of collaboration box June 2001 with my friend Teri.  I carved the stamp she provided the box and logbook, and we did the clues together.  Hmmm I wonder if that box is still there.  I'll have to find the time to look for it some time soon.<br>

I've always had difficulty giving away (or loosing when one of my boxes disappears) my stamps.  If I carved a stamp in tribute to someone or something that I care a lot about I wouldn't want to give it up.  I like the idea of the tribute logbook though.    <br>

Yes, I'm glad the Sunny Day Collaboration box has instructions about the stamp size.<br>
<br>
I spent days working on my stamp for the candle box, creating an original design, re-carving it twice and making it small so there would be room for everyone else's stamps in the box. Then when I logged in, the other stamps were so huge, even with large un-trimmed borders, I felt sure my tiny stamp would be easily overlooked and  lost.  So at the last minute I chickened out and didn't leave it.  *blush*<br>

If anybody who found "a single flame" is coming to a gathering and wants me to bring the little candle to add to your page, e-mail me and I can bring it along!<br>
<br>
Dafamily, I promise to be stronger when I visit your collaboration box!  =-)<br>
