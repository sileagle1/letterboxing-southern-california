On the way down to Seal Beach, Gwen and I went after #1 and #6. Is there an off ramp for Orange Grove? or did you mean Oak Grove? We were heading east on 210. We found the touch screen television, but there wasn't a John Woodson listed. We did have a little travel numbness going by this time so it may not be clue problem it might be clue reader problem?<br>

First of all, a very humble apology for my mistake about the name <br>
John Woodson--this is completely wrong--I must have been tired out <br>
after a long day of clue hiding.  The correct name to look for in <br>
clue #6 of my Halloween Series is James Brooks (not even close to <br>
John Woodson).  I apologize for sending you off on a wild goose <br>
chase. If you're going to be in Pasadena on a weekend day in the <br>
future, give me a call and I'd be glad to accompany you through the <br>
series, or just to meet for coffee. Contact me off group for my phone <br>
number.  Orange Grove is one of the main streets in Pasadena, and <br>
there is an exit for it going east or west on the 210 freeway.  If <br>
you were traveling east on the 210, you'd have gone through the city <br>
of Glendale, then Eagle Rock, then you'd have seen the Pasadena <br>
bridge to your right paralleling the freeway--the exit off the 210 <br>
near the east end of the bridge is Orange Grove.<br>

You're absolutely right, and this explains why Don & Gwen couldn't <br>
find the Orange Grove offramp from the 210 Freeway.  The 210 Freeway <br>
merges with the 134 Freeway one exit east of Orange Grove Boulevard <br>
at Fair Oaks Avenue.  The 134 ends here and the 210 takes over, but <br>
Orange Grove Boulevard is actually off the 134 Freeway one exit west <br>
of the interchange, not off the 210!  These two freeways come <br>
together at this spot, and will likely cause a lot of confusion for <br>
letterboxers unfamiliar with Los Angeles freeways (heck, I'm real <br>
familiar with L.A. freeways, and I missed this).  I will rewrite my <br>
clues saying the exit is off the 134.<br>
