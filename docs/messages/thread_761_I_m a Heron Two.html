After all this time?  I seem to recall that logbook going way back.  Did it come up missing?<br>

We think so. We received a 'could not find' report on it and when we went back to the site we couldn't find it either. The bushes had all grown up. When we planted it there was only a very, very small bush next to the 2nd gangway. Now it is huge.<br>
<br>
We found a better spot a short way from the original spot. Better go out and get it......new stamp, new clues. Unfortunately we kept it listed under original title and for those logging finds it won't count for another box if you have already logged it online.<br>
<br>
On side note we recently received a note from a finder (out of state) wondering about our lack or rather non use of the Blue Diamond ratings at AQ.<br>
<br>
Our Profile page at AQ does have a mention of our feelings, but for some that have not read the profile here is the way we feel.<br>
<br>
We don't letterbox to receive ratings or give out ratings. We place letterboxes because we enjoy giving a plant.<br>
We understand there are those that like the Blue Diamond ratings just as there are those that enjoy the "count" of the PFX. That is okay by us. On our boxes you will not find our preference for "Planter's Choice" as our planters choice is the last box we have planted. On the same vein our favorite find will be the next one!<br>
<br>
Play the game that YOU want to play and don't worry about the way others play.<br>
