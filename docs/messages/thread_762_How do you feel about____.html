We have friends who we sort of introduced to LB'ing unintentionally.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, I think geocaching may be better for them.  I feel the same way about the logbook, if it was my box, I would want the acknowledgment that someone was there...that's half the fun, and I love seeing other stamps.  I'm also concerned about them being careless about it....with no accountability.  They haven't read any of the rules, or really anything about it that I know of.  I think they just do it to prove to themselves they can find it and that's it.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am just annoyed about the way they adopted our hobby. lol!  When we were doing it, and sort of included them by letting them come along on the hike, the guy looked at the clue sheet and literally ran ahead of us trying to find it before we got there, then stood next to where he thought it was, grinning.  (he was wrong) It was just annoying, and I felt like he missed the point completely.  I am afraid that he's being just as careless when they do it alone, and it's our fault for telling them about it!  )0:<br/>

I just wanted to know how other people felt about it!  Maybe I will try not to feel so guilty about it.  Thanks for your input. (0:<br/>

I'm in complete agreement with Don on this.  If all they are doing is looking at what's already there, are being careful with the logbook, etc, then they aren't hurting anyone.  How do we know that these folks are the only ones doing things this way?  There is no way to know; there could be dozens of boxers out there who never stamp a thing, but enjoy looking for the box.<br/>
<br/>
As for geocaching, there are more than a few cachers who never log any of their finds on-line, and never sign the logbooks in the caches.  There are even cachers who look up the coords for archived caches, and then go to the coordinates just to see where the cache used to be.  I can see the point; there must have been a reason for the cache being there in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Rock bottom: we keep telling new-comers that there are many ways to play the game.  IMHO, this is just one of those many ways :-)  And lots of boxers say that they try to hide LBs in interesting or scenic spots, and want folks to enjoy the hike and the area around the box.  If this is truly the case, then stamping the logbook really is secondary, isn't it?  These folks just take it to an extreme ;-)<br/>

<br/>
Personally, I love to have people log in my boxes. I check almost every day hoping that someone has logged a find in one of my boxes, but the real reason that I put my boxes out is so others can enjoy them. How can I be angry just because they don't log the finds? As for not putting them back well, I've had some AQ logging boxers rehide poorly, and some that only signed the book rehide well.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like your friends like the scavenger hunt aspect, but do not enjoy the stamps. Geocaching probably wouldn't appeal as much to them (they seem to like solving the clues, and geocaching doesn't have that), but you might show them how it's done and see. If you really think they should log finds, you might ask them just to sign their names into the logbook when they find a box, or log it on atlasquest. If they don't want to take the time, then you might suggest that they locate the box, but do not retrieve it. That way the integrity of the hide will not be broken. <br/>
<br/>
More like three cents, but there you have it.<br/>

People will play the game their own way, which I mind at all as long as they play by the rules. There are hard and fast rules about not revealing boxes and ensuring that boxes remain safe, but if people choose not to stamp in, it isn't a big deal as long as they don't compromise the secrecy of the boxes and hiding locations. Just because they don't stamp in (even though stamping in would be great), they're still enjoying the hunt like the rest of us, and shouldn't be deprived of this joy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That being said, it's great to see this board is as active as ever, and that folks are continuing to look out for the integrity of this wonderful pastime!! =)<br/>
