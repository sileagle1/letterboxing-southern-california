The "Marsh Preserve" box has been there all along, but since the landmarks changed, it hasn't been found since a few weeks after I planted it, so it has new clues.  I replaced the "Dive N' Surf" box with new clues.<br>
<br>
"Rails-To-Trails" and "Reservoir Dogs" are both fine.  When I checked on "SST Records" it was gone. :(  The rock had been moved, so it looked very deliberate, like someone discovered it and threw it away.  Since I had some materials on me, I very quickly did a new carve and replaced it.  Too quickly.  I hand-drew the old stamp onto the rubber without thinking, so it's a mirror image.  I'm an idiot.  Still, better than a missing box.<br>

PS  Anybody having any luck with "Bridge"?  I think it's the cleverest clue I've come up with.  Apparently, though, the only way I'll ever stump Bumblebeebunny is if I chop 'em down like a tree.  :)<br>

Please, sir, trumpet away!  I could use a good fanfare this morning.<br>

Not only do you like to trumpet your plans, but you also like to toot your own horn.  I've been carrying around that bridge plan with me for a week or so now and I have to say it may be a little TOO clever for me.  I'll let you know when I have another bald patch, if I let it get to that point (I'm much more relaxed these days, you know).<br>
