This was reported as being "missing" but we checked on 8/28/09 and it was fine. Had been stamped-in on 8/8/09 by someone with an orange "horse" stamp -- they didn't sign their trailname, but acknowledged being our first finders for the box. This find has not been logged on AtlasQuest, which is why it shows as never having been found yet.<br>
<br>
It is kind of a high traffic area, lots of trash around and sometimes people too, but for now, we'll keep it where it is.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
