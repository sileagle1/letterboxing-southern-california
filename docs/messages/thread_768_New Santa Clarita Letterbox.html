<br>
Just before I headed down to this garden spot I had an opportunity to plant "Stagecoach at Beale's Cut". For some reason you can not go to the sites in the clues by clicking on the links provided. If you cut and paste into your browser then you can access those sites. Checking the location out before hand will certainly add to the letterboxing experience.<br>
<br>
Oh yeh, I did NOT hide anything in Nyland as only mad dogs and Englishmen (and Dove hunters) should venture there.<br>
