If you check out his Sig Stamp, you'll see what I mean.<br>
I was wondering if he took a class in engraving and now I see where his "style" comes from.<br>
I got a few of his stamps, but unfortunately, the paper I used was a little too absorbent and does not do his work justice. <br>

In the lastest Westways Mag there is an article "The Artistry of Printmaking" . The artist used as example is Paul Landacre. I googled Paul Landacre after seeing some of his wood carvings and his art is excellant and something good carvers (of stamps) should try to reproduce.<br>
