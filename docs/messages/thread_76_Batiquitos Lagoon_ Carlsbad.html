I just returned from a 3 day visit to Carlsbad. What beautiful <br>
weather and blue skies after the fires. I took a hike over to the <br>
Batiquitos Lagoon and found the letterbox there. The lagoon was <br>
gorgeous and the egrets and sandpipers were out in abundance. <br>
Also found the "Moving a Giraffe is a TALL order" HH. So will be <br>
placing near here in the future. Purple Iris<br>

Carlsbad is my hometown, and I'm sure you noticed my Buzzard Stamp in <br>
this boxes stampbook, unless it's been replaced.  I visited this box <br>
on a visit to my parents (who still live in Carlsbad) and took them <br>
along on the trip; this was their introduction to letterboxing.  I <br>
think I've got my older brother interested, but he's so busy.  I'm <br>
glad to hear the box is still there.<br>

Buzzard,<br>
What a beautiful hometown. I'm sorry I didn't really have a chance to <br>
check out the logbook as the cousin that was with me, was anxious to <br>
move on. She wanted to know if I had the clues to find our way back. <br>
LOL. Anyway the box has had quite a few visitors. And it was a <br>
beautiful day for a short hike. Purple Iris<br>
