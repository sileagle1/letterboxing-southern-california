                    <div class="plaintext-content">I updated the Atlas Quest event page with additional details and a couple of questions.<br>
<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1381<br>
<br>
1) If you are coming out to help plant, would you rather come one week prior to the event on November 1 (the day after Halloween) or two weeks prior to the event on October 24 or October 25? <br>
<br>
2) Would you be interested in going out for pizza after the event is over?<br>
<br>
Please give me your opinion on these questions!<br>
<br>
Also, the event will be a semi-potluck. You are responsible for your own main lunch item and your own drinks, but I am requesting that you bring something else to share. If you edit your event sign up, you can state what you are going to bring.<br>
<br>
I also want to thank Buffalo Tony, Maule, Atlas, Lee, Kelsung, and Gray for driving around with me this weekend to find the location.<br>
<br>
-Piper Paws<br>
<br>
Here is a copy of the event posting from Atlas Quest.<br>
<br>
Location: We will be meeting at the Fern Dell Picnic Area at Griffith Park. This area is on Fern Dell Drive off of Los Feliz Blvd (just East of Western). There is a parking lot on the left and a picnic area on the right. We will be somewhere in the picnic area. This spot has lots of tables, lots of shade, restrooms, and a small playground. There is no grass though, so you may want to bring a chair or picnic blanket to toss on the ground. Griffith park is dog friendly, but dogs must remain on a leash at all times. Additionally, the picnic area is very shady, but many of the trails are in full sun.<br>
<br>
Schedule: I am not planning any specific events. If you are interested in creating/hosting an event (i.e some kind of class or a kid specific thing), let me know and I will post details. As for a general schedule, there will be a check-in table and an event stamp. I will hang around the event site at least until after lunch, but after that I might pack up the check-in table and go out and do some boxing!<br>
<br>
Food: We will have a semi-potluck, you are responsible for your own main lunch item and your own drinks. Please bring something else to share. We will start early, so you can bring a breakfast item, snacks for anytime of the day, a side dish, or a dessert.<br>
<br>
Boxes: Please consider contributing a box. We will get together before hand to plant, so you can either plant your own box, donate a box, and/or come help plant all the boxes! If you plant a box for the event, either make sure I have the clues prior to the event, or bring your own clue sheet.<br>
<br>
Questions: If you are coming out to help plant, would you rather come one week prior to the event on November 1 (the day after Halloween) or two weeks prior to the event on October 24 or October 25? Would you be interested in going out for pizza after the event is over?<br>

Our vote is for October 24th!  We'd love to go out for pizza after the event if it's dog-friendly (i.e. outdoor seating).<br>

I've already told a few of you, but just wanted to whine and moan publicly.  I was looking forward to meeting a lot of newer boxers, as well as catching up with older ones.  But I need the money.<br>
<br>
I'll probably pass Pappasky somewhere on the 10 as he's driving in.<br>
<br>
At least last week I got to plant 10 of the boxes you'll be finding.  I still think my wife, Zuhl is Cool, is planning on going without me, and maybe the kids will go with her.  Everybody have a great time and I swear I'm coming to the next big one, no matter what.<br>
