Will remake the box and try and come up with a new hiding spot, but that could be months in the future.  The clues have been updated to this effect.<br>

I thought I was being pretty clever, but nope - I guess you have to think outside the "box" (ha ha) when planting :-)<br>

Found as recently as 9/19, this box had gone missing by 9/21.<br>
I visited the park today and checked, and it's missing for sure.<br>
Kelsung warned me there was too much traffic there... the box lasted nearly a month. Hey, but that's how we learn better hiding techniques, yes?<br>

I have to agree it was a pretty busy spot - I had to pass it a couple times before the traffic went away long enough to retrieve the box.<br>
It's a great series and I recommend it even without poor box # 4!  <br>
