Yes but we have long ago forsaken planting in NPS areas, and in other parks we ask for forgiveness rather than ask for permission. This does make clue writing interesting and even though we no longer plant in NPS areas, we do have some that have been in place a long,long time.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not advocating planting in areas that wish permits or no plants as unless the clue sheet is properly masked it does create a problem for host web sites.<br/>
<br/>
If clues are set up and called "Half Dome", "Yellowstone", or some other name that is obvious then those will get confiscated. We do have one called "Yosemite" but that is more of a tweek for NPS and it is not on NPS turf.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately around Kernville, most of the land is controlled by BLM or Forest Service and there biggest problem is illegal cash crops.<br/>

<br/>
The only time we have had permission before hand was at LB State. I saw the Pres. Bob Maxon at a Rotary meeting and casually asked him if it was okay to hide a few boxes there. He agreed, but I wasn't sure he totally knew what I was talking about.<br/>
<br/>
We had a meeting with the folks at Bixby Hill Rancho and in that meeting was representatives from the other Bixby Ranch and Molla (Spelling?)<br/>
<br/>
Those folks wanted a letterbox planted but wanted to set it up for the general public and have a letterbox clinic/carving session for the public during one of their events there.<br/>
<br/>
I could not think of a way to really do this due to the stealth aspect of letterboxing so we passed on the project.<br/>

The one Vienna placed in the hedge has gone missing.  I think it was Presidents' Day last February, when the kids and I "did Alhambra" (letterboxing, that is).  We found the OTHER box at Fosselman's Ice Cream, but the one in the hedge was gone.<br/>
