                    <div class="plaintext-content">A couple weeks back I was looking through the Atlas Quest Event Planning and News board, in case there was any updates to the upcoming Griffith Park event.  Someone called DS posted, that Sept 26th was Museum Day and you could get into many of the museums for free that day.  Not wanting to pass up a bargain, I looked for museums that sounded interesting.  Nancy and I decided on the Museum of Neon Art (MONA) and the Getty Center.  We were quite disappointed with MONA, but as we came out, there directly in front of us was Q - the organizer of the Old Zoo Gathering in Grifffith Park back in 2005.  She was working with the filming of a commercial there on the street.  For those that did not make that 2005 event, Q got us started but had to leave within the first hour to go to work, so we only met breifly. <br>
<br>
So, what are the odds that a free day at the museum, would have me downtown LA, as production of this commercial was ending, and that I would recognize, let alone see Q there, this close to the upcoming Griffith Park event?  I did invite her and hope she comes to the event.<br>

That's really cool!  It would be great to meet her, and I'm also looking forward to meeting Wendy Gault.  It'd be nice to get to know some older boxers who haven't been around in a while.<br>
