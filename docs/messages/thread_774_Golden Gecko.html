Does anyone know what happened to Golden Gecko?  Her accounts and all her boxes on LbNA and AQ have been deleted.  She's right here in the same town, but I never got to meet her and now she's disappeared.  I'm worried it was something I said.<br/>

I haven't really taken it personally, it's just odd and I was trying to guess why she's gone.  And I didn't send her an email cuz I didn't have one, since her accounts were deleted.<br/>
