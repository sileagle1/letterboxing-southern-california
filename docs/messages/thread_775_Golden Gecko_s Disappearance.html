www.letterboxing.org?  After reading Kelsung's inquiry on her wellbeing, I<br>
tried both atlasquest and letterboxing.org, and couldn't find any boxes<br>
listed with her as the planter/owner, and indeed, she wasn't listed as a<br>
member of either group.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Seems like something drastic must have happened, to inspire her to not just<br>
let participation lapse, but to actively quit and withdraw from all of it.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Praying for her, and for her family. since none of us knows, really, what<br>
could have happened.<br>
