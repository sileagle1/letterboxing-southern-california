<br/>
Based on the feedback I got, Saturday, October 24 is the day I can get the most people to help plant boxes at Griffith Park.  Tdyans says she will have about 6 series of various sizes, so the more people who can help, the better!  And I want to say thank you to Tdyans for getting so many people to send us stamps and taking care of this aspect of the Gathering!<br/>
<br/>
We will meet at 10AM at the Fern Dell Picnic Site on Sat Oct 24.  If you can come and help, please let me know ahead of time.  Send me an email here or on AQ.<br/>
<br/>
This will also be a great opportunity to plant some of your own boxes, so come join us!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
