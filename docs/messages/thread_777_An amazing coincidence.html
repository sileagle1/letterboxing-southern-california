                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, this amazing thing happened today!<br>
<br>
On Sept. 15, I planted my second letterbox, at Shadow Ranch Park in West Hills. Since then I visited it twice to make minor modifications, but nobody else stamped in until Oct. 2, after which I received notification on Atlas Quest. So today, at around 3 p.m., I took time off from work to visit the box a third time to see the stamp. <br>
<br>
As I walked from my car toward the box, I saw a woman and two teenage boys get up from the area where I'd planted the box and walk in my direction. The woman was carrying a black book. I thought, "these people must be letterboxers!"<br>
<br>
So I asked: "Excuse me, were you just visiting my letterbox?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, we were," the lady replied. "Are you Old Roar?"<br>
<br>
It turns out this was the third letterbox they tried to find today -- and their first successful find ever! They asked me to sign their book to record the moment.<br>
<br>
What are the odds of this sort of thing happening? Has anything like this happened to anyone else here?<br>

<br>
This just reminds me of my early days of planting, when I would check LbNA every day to see if anyone had found one, and go out and visit my boxes ever couple weeks.  I've definitely settled down on that.<br>

Old Roar, you ran into my friend/co-worker, Cat - I introduced her to letterboxing and she was so excited to tell me about what had happened! I even saw your autograph in her book. Haha good times!<br>
<br>
You also have emailed my mother recently (Head of the Pack) because she was having a difficult time finding the Victory Trailhead box. Well, on Halloween, my wife and I (Team Ferguson) found the Kiss the Fist World Tour hitchhiker that you planted in the Victory Trailhead box and we will be bringing it to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in December. Not to mention, your Shadow Ranch box was the first box WE found!<br>
<br>
Is seems like there are "amazing coincidences" everywhere...<br>

I haven't been able to find the owner of Kiss the Fist, but I felt personally responsible for its survival. I'm glad it will now reach the East Coast in December. <br>

Will you be joining us next weekend at Griffith Park?<br>
