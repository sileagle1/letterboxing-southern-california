Now, if you pur "hostel Burbank" into Google, you will get a string of them south of Griffith Park, in Hollywood; guess there *=aren't any hostels actually in Burbank.<br/>

There are several good LBs in Griffith Park and Hollywood.  Any of the five listed in Hollywood on LbNA are worth a try, as is "Griffith Park" or "Griffith Park II" (listed under Los Angeles).  Apparently "Mt. Lee" is missing (also under Los Angeles), but it's a great hike.  If you are willing to go a short distance on a freeway, or are willing to buy a *good* map of the Basin for surface street routing, try "Rose Garden", which is in Exposition Park near the USC campus and the LA Coliseum.  The museums in the park are a must-see, LBs or not.<br/>
<br/>
In actuality, as someone who has lived 53 of my 57 years in SoCal, while the freeways can be a bear, on the weekends they are not nearly so bad as their rep.  Accidents can happen at 65 or 45 or 15 MPH, so that's just part of the deal on any road: you might get caught in a jam, but there is always a way around.  And you won't find a moose or bear (except for a CHP officer) anywhere on the roads ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you have a good time!  Be sure to visit the Observatory while you are here!  I worked there in the 70s; the place has really changed since then, and is a lot more up-to-date.  www.griffithobs.org is the website.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">after a quick search on travelocity, I found a plethora of upstanding hotels that I could recommend to friends (but not enemies) for around $65.  That could be a little out of your price range, but with a bit of creative searching and an adjustment of the location, I'm sure you would be able to find something that suits your needs.<br/>
