<br>
Griffith Park: The Sequel is only 5 days away. I hope you all had a great Halloween and are as excited as I am for this weekend.<br>
<br>
A couple of reminders:<br>
<br>
1) Food: You are responsible for your own main lunch item and your own drinks. Please bring something else to share.<br>
<br>
2) Weather: The even site is shaded and may be cool, especially earlier in the day, but many of the trails are in full sun. <br>
<br>
3) Boxes: If you planted or are planning on planting a box for the event and want the clues included in the event clue packet, please send them to me by Thursday at the very latest. Otherwise, plan on disseminating your clues by another method. The clue packet will only include clues for boxes planted for the event. There are older boxes at Griffith Park and you may want to look those clues up before you come.<br>
<br>
Here is the Atlas Quest event link for additional information.<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1381<br>
<br>
See you Saturday!<br>
Piper Paws<br>

Glad you'll get to be there, Gecko_Ferg...<br>
<br>
DID ANYONE EVER FIND GOLDEN GECKO?<br>

Wish I could be there/we could be there... but alas!<br>

Have fun, everybody!<br>

Blessings,<br>

Yes, she has decided not to continue Letterboxing. It has nothing to do with anyone, it was a personal decision.<br>

Thanks, Don.  So sorry to see her go, but I'm glad to at least have some closure and know (okay, assume) that Golden Gecko is alright.<br>
  Also sorry that I never had a chance to look for her letterbox plants.<br>
