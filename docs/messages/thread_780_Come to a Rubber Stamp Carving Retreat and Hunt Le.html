<br>
Just wanted to let you know that it is not too late if you would like to come to a rubber stamp carving retreat, Stampfest 2009. This will be year 18 for me and I wouldn't miss it.  Stampfest is led by Kat Okamoto the owner of A Stamp In The Hand and The Original Rubberstamp Convention.<br>
<br>
Spending a long weekend surrounded by friendly creative people is rejuvenating and fun. This event is open to all levels of carvers, beginners to experts, and a great opportunity to learn new techniques and share your favorite creative techniques.<br>
<br>
Casa de Maria is an amazing location in Montecito (just South of Santa Barbara), picturesque and close to the beach. The food is wonderfully fresh and delicious.<br>
<br>
In addition to our yearly Carved Rubberstamp Art Swap (everyone who participates goes home with a stack of hand created postcard sized prints), there are short seminars on beautiful techniques and fun projects with materials provided.  There will be a series (I think it's almost 10 boxes) of temporary letterboxes (just for the weekend) available to hunt too.  Great fun and all located "on campus".<br>
<br>
When you arrive on Friday afternoon, Nov. 20, you get your own workspace, half of an 8 foot table, to set up with all your tools and supplies for the weekend.  We all pack-up and leave by Noon on Monday, Nov. 23.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions or would like further information please contact Kat Okamoto at (310) 721-9492.<br>
<br>
I hope you can make it!!<br>
<br>
Love To Carve<br>
