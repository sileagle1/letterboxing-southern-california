<br/>
I just wanted to say I had an awesome time seeing the usual crew again and meeting some new faces today!! Stu, Maggie, and I had a blast!  Lots of boxing and "interesting" experiences throughout the day.  Thanks Piper Paws for organizing this event!  I know a lot of folks put a ton of work into carving and planting...great job everyone!!  LBers are such a great group of people!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, someone left their green folding chair and a straw hat at the event.  I have it with me, so if it's yours, email or message me and I can coordinate with you on how to get it to you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the wonderful time everyone, and I hope to see you all soon!!<br/>

Wait, a GREEN chair?  Have you asked GeoGeorgia?   She's left green things behind at events before.<br/>

I have extra clue packets if anyone wants one.  Especially if you couldn't make it and are planning a trip to Griffith Park in the near future.  Just email me here or on Atlas Quest with your snail mail address.<br/>
