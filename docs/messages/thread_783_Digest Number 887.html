>Hey Everyone!<br>
><br>
>I just wanted to say I had an awesome time seeing the usual crew again and meeting some new faces today!! Stu, Maggie, and I had a blast!  Lots of boxing and "interesting" experiences throughout the day.  Thanks Piper Paws for organizing this event!  I know a lot of folks put a ton of work into carving and planting...great job everyone!!  LBers are such a great group of people!<br>
><br>
>By the way, someone left their green folding chair and a straw hat at the event.  I have it with me, so if it's yours, email or message me and I can coordinate with you on how to get it to you.<br>
><br>
>Thanks again for the wonderful time everyone, and I hope to see you all soon!!<br>

>We couldn't agree more. Thank you so much to everyone for putting this event together. We were a little hesitant at first, but we sure had a great time meeting everyone and finding boxes today! There is so much talent among us! It's nice to finally put a face to all of the names we see on the trail. We can't wait for the next one!<br>
