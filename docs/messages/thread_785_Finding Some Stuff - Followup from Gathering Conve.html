<br/>
BRILLIANCE STAMP PADS<br/>
<br/>
The Original Rubber Stamp Convention<br/>
Some of you asked me where I got my Brilliance Stamp Pads... well this is one place that I usually find them.  Of course there are many other fun supplies (if all you want is carving material, I have rarely found it here) and cool techniques and lots of cool stuff that you can use for your LTCs.  There are Make and Takes, and a variety of  mini-lectures.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who don't carve and are always on the lookout for stamps that relate to the place you want to plant... well this is a great place to look for cool art stamps.<br/>
<br/>
