On the Thursday before the gathering, my husband and I were leaving Fern Canyon Nature Trail and saw a foursome of inappropriately attired people entering the trail.

The long and short of it is, they asked us if we had a map of Griffith Park.  I pulled out our copy of the map I included with the clue packets and said, we had this, but it wasn't that great.  Well, Mr. Politician says "We have a great map.  We'll send you one."  I got the email address of one of the women and sent her my information.  <br/>
<br/>
I got the map in the mail today and it is a great map!  I suggest that anyone who wants a great map of Griffith Park to contact Councilmember Tom LaBonge's office and request a copy of the Map &amp; Guide of Griffith Park.  <br/>
