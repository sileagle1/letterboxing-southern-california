I'm chiming in way late here, but I wanted to Thank Piper Paws for putting on such a nice Event!! <br>
Thanks to all who planted and carved as well - I can't believe it's been a week already :-P<br>
What great fun - it was so nice seeing everyone and meeting new folks as well, and I actually got to hunt Letterboxes at an Event - woohoo :-)<br>
However, and I am not afraid to admit it - I was sooooo sore when I got home - Ben Gay definitely became a good friend that night :-}<br>
But hey, it was a good sore . . . .ouch.<br>
Thanks again, to everyone, for such a great day!<br>
