Since the clues are posted on the old site, my guess is that some time in the future the old site will disappear. (Is my guess valid Jay?) Apparently the placer of the letterbox is not letterboxing now. We are in Kernville more than Seal Beach and have a bunch of our own to maintain or we would snap it up. This is a very heavily visited box, with several entries from Geo folks and Letterboxers.Our timing was very good on this  LB trip as we picked up "Heads" HH, and got an exchange too. Our Seal Beach apt is very close to two of the LBs in the Seal Beach Town Tour  and we spotted Dan and Brenda from Stanton working on the Anaheim Landing plaque. New letterboxers of two weeks. Geeeze this is just like Ct.with letterboxers just tripping over each other. Well maybe not quite, we don't have the cold and snow.<br/>

Hiya! Yeah, eventually the old-site archive will go away, but there <br/>
are no plans to do it soon. We still hear about a box or two that got <br/>
overlooked in the changeover, and we don't want to see boxes left out <br/>
because of our error. <br/>
<br/>
I went over to find this box and was surpised at how clunky the old <br/>
site was to use. Guess I'm brainwashed by Wes' new magic. Anyway, <br/>
boxes like this one are a dilemma: the clues are on a personal <br/>
website, which makes meddling with them a bit more invasive. I'll put <br/>
it up on the new LbNA for now and hope someone on the list will adopt <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for pointing it out,<br/>

This LB is also listed on it's own. When I was checking the web Batiquitos listings for more info on the lagoon ,the clue page was listed. There have been many geocachers at this LB so they may be picking the LB clues from the web listing not the LBNA site. Does this happen often? or is this just a rare occurrence ? Can this happen with other LBs, say ours for example? Don<br/>
