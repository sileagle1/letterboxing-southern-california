<br>
It's been a while since I've been on.  Ups and downs medically.  Anyway I'd love to be involved in the Chino one.  The girls and I have yet to make a stamp but this would definately be a great opportunity for it. For me it would be better in March.  The heat in June isn't very nice to me.  But what ever you all pick is fine.  If it's March I'll make it if not I'll have to see what the weather is like.  <br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
Heather<br>

  I'm already thinking ahead. For a long time now I've wanted to get some plants into Chino Hills State Park, which is huge and untapped. So now I'm wondering if we could turn it into an event and change that.<br>
<br>
  The thing is, I'd like to organize it so that different series' are on different trails and cover a lot of ground. I want to avoid any overlapping. Many of us in SoCal are spoiled by lots of drive-bys, but this calls for some good hikes, and I'm thinking some longer series' of 8-12 boxes.<br>
<br>
  Now, we could have this in either March or June, but not in between. The question is whether you all want to see Piper Paws 8 months pregnant, or with a new baby. :)<br>

I would vote for June because I'd love to see the baby, but by then we'll be in full swing with Ren Faire.  The kids & I could definitely make Chino in March, my littlest will be 2 then.  It's a lot closer for us than Griffith Park.  <br>

Ok, so you're bringing us out of the woodwork, too! We were at the Vista<br>
gathering as well, but kind of dropped out for a while after that...<br>
Life, you know...  Acorn and Starfish are excited to get started again.<br>
<br>
I've been planning a series for Chino Hills for a couple of years, and<br>
still haven't done anything about it... Life, you know...  ;-)<br>

Yippee! Glad to be back!<br>

Anyhow, we were at the SD gathering, my Bella was the little blonde with<br>
the Blues Clues pawprint t-shirt (that looks like Piper Paws' stamp!).<br>
She drew the names for the drawing. Anyhow, it has been a while, I won't<br>

I had said I would have my girls make a stamp but didn't realize the series had to be as a set of animals or whatever all had decided on. lol So I will wait until it is decided what we are to make. I still have to order the eraser material.  Can someone be so kind as to send me the site again? I would like to get them ordered for one of their Christmas presents.  <br>
<br>
And with the dates in March, any of those is fine, just as long as I get a good months heads up.  With the girls and all of their activities I have learned to keep my calendar close at hand.  Rain or shine lol  As long as it's not in the 100's.  I'll melt lol.  <br>
<br>
Thanks Bunches<br>

I've been contacted by a fellow letterboxer who actually works at Chino Hills State Park!  They've given me ideas for a location, maps, and offered to help with the planting with insider access.<br>
<br>
So to make this official, what date works best for everyone?  I'm thinking a Saturday, March 6th, 13th or 20th.<br>

I also think it should start early to leave time for a meet & greet, followed by a long hike.  How early is too early?<br>

Beyond that, contact me if you can be involved in planting.  That includes two different things:  1 - Carving a stamp(s) and donating a box(es) and/or 2 - Getting together (a week or so?) before the event to hike and plant boxes and write clues.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of nature themed boxes:  wild animals, coyotes, rabbits, hawks, maybe trees/plants.  And maybe some kind of hiking theme, like a backpack, canteen, tent, compass, etc.  Any other ideas?<br>

<br>
I've put March 13th on my calendar, and listed it for 9am.  The time is only my guesstimate, but it sounds like a good time to me.  (Now you have my vote, for timing.)<br>
<br>
That's all, for now ~ thanks!<br>

Just not 5am lol. And I'm fine with meeting up the week before also.  March 13th was one I voted for because of the awful heat we get.  The girls and I have never done a meet & greet so we are excited about that.  If there is information we need for the meet and greet could you please fill me in.  TY <br>
Kelsung do you have a flickr or photo account?  Where you have pictures?<br>
<br>
My daughter says she can do a bird, or a tree.  She's the artist here.  There is no way I could do it lol.  Do you do your carvings there when you meet the week before?  <br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

It would be best to have all the boxes prepared when we meet to plant them.<br>
