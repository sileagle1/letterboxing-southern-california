                    <div class="plaintext-content">GREAT! :-) We aren't far from Chino so I'll have to do some investigating myself lol. The girls will be so excited.  Oh I just thought of a great xmas gift for all three....one of the carving erasers.  I wonder what look they'll give me.  lol  <br>
I've been here and I've done lots of boxes with the girls but my legs kept swelling and it felt like my feet were dying.  A new doctor barely touched my back and what ever she did undid what was pinched.  Now I'm dealing with heart palpitations. So no more caffene or chocolate for me.  I don't eat much chocolate and caffene is no biggie.  So I'm sure I'll be there in March.  I was also told I might have lung cancer recently.  Lucky me I think someone's seeing how much I can handle. lol  Well the spot in the xray they thought was the big c isn't but they did find another on the catscan.  Which is too small to do anything with but watch.  Anyway after all I've been through over the last three years I am still here and kicking even more now than before lol.  <br>

  Okay, March it is, then. I was thinking the same thing about the weather after I posted. And I love that we brought Beach Celt and Craftlover out of the woodwork, too. New folks to meet!<br>
<br>
  I'll start looking into possible locations and trail information. I know there's a link right in here in the newsgroup.<br>

<br>
I never did get up the mountain but I heard from friends up in Cherry Valley that everything up there was fine.  I just figured you'd seen the same with the news.<br>
<br>
I hope your holidays have been going wonderfully.<br>
