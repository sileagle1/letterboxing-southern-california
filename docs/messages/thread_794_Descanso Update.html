Said shrubs have thrived there for years, but the wildfires last summer destroyed  much habitat in the foothills, and that may be causing the wildlife to forage more aggressively in places which weren't burned. The other three boxes in the gardens are still in place.<br>
Happy Turkey Day, everyone!<br>
