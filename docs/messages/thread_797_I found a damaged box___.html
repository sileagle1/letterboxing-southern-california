Does anyone know of an old box planted north of the Rose Bowl on a trail that goes under the 210 near Arroyo Blvd?  The stamp is a tiny eraser with an image of a dolphin.  I've dug through the basement at LbNA but didn't find anything that matches.<br>

Hadn't thought of that.  It's possible.<br>
<br>
But it was in a freezer bag wrapped in a napkin, I found a second freezer bag that probably had the log (all soaking wet), and the container appears to have a faint stamping of the dolphin on the lid, but it is nearly washed off, so it may be my imagination.<br>
<br>
Hmmm....?<br>

It is hand-carved.  I was looking for Triburcio Vasquez #4.  The four Hahamonga boxes I got back in 06, so I know it isn't one of them, nor is it the Halloween Skeleton Cat, which was there also.  The only other box clue I found near it was Pasadena Rose, but its location would have been about a half-mile downstream, so it couldn't be it.  The only others even close are Vasquez #3 and the Kidspace box, again too far away.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Interesting!   I notice the Hahamongna series clues have been pulled, so it's possible someone pulled the clues for this one too, or that it was a mystery box not listed by city. <br>
<br>
It's cool that you found it, at any rate.  Perhaps it can join Geisha Girl's Miraculous Fire-Breathing E.T. Box in the Letterbox Museum at the next gathering. Someone may recognize it.<br>
<br>
p.s.  Was it up on the bridge, or down near the wall?<br>
