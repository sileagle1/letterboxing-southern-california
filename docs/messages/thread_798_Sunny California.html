  I am a letterboxer from Missouri and leaving for my yearly trip to the South Bay area to visit my family.  My sister, brother and mom live in Torrance, PV, and San Pedro.  They don't letterbox and question my enthusiasm for searching out Tupperware.  I have started researching the boxes in the area, hoping to find some that would entice them to find another and another and another.... I contacted Kelsung about one of his boxes and he pointed me to this site.  I can't wait to get there and start finding some of the offerings in your area.  I have already been to many of the places where boxes area hidden, but didn't know about LBing at the time.  It will be fun to see their faces when we find treasures we never knew were there.  Since I probably can't fit in all the boxes, I would love to hear about any particular favorites you may know of that would help with my endeavor to introduce my family to my newest obsession, Letterboxing! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome!   You have good timing - there are several newish plants in the Torrance/PV   area. I haven't found them so I can't make specific recommendations. One great historic box is Don and Gwen's Point Vicente Lighthouse box which was planted in 2001. Looking through the logbook is practically a history lesson. = )  <br/>
<br/>
We had a gathering in Griffith Park last month so there are over 30 new boxes there!   If your family aren't into hiking, several of the boxes in the Fern Dell area are more accessible. If they're hikers, there are some very cool series on the north, "zoo" side of the park. (Griffith Park actually has three different "access" points that are not connected by public roads in the park. The third area, Bronson Canyon, has the original, 1960's  Batcave and a letterbox commemorating it, as well as more boxes.) <br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of variety in So Cal, so hopefully you can find some boxes in places your relatives want to visit, anyway.<br/>

Thanks everyone for your suggestions. I have my list printed and am checking it twice. :-).  Sounds like there are some great finds available.  Can't wait for my first meet and greet and with 20 degree weather here, I can't wait to arrive there! <br/>
