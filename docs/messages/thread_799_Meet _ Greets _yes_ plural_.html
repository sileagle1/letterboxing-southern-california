I Dig Toasters from Missouri will be visiting the South Bay over the holidays and I suggested a get-together.  Considering how crazy the holidays will get, she thought sooner would be better than later.<br>
<br>
So, on short notice, who could make it to lunch on Saturday?  I was thinking Souplantation again in the Del Amo mall, since it is both reasonably priced and easily accommodates a larger group.  They open at 11am, so how about just after that?  We can all trickle in by noon.<br>
<br>
Since it's short notice, I'll just post an event on AQ now, and change it if I need to later.  So get your protests of time and location in now!<br>
<br>
...And another thing.  Doublesaj and Old Blue posted on AQ that they will be down this way briefly, and wanted to see if anyone could get together on Tue the 22nd between 9 and 5 in the Fullerton or surrounding area.  Sadly, I'll be working, but I wanted to spread the word.<br>

Whew!<br>
