Gwen &amp; I returned to find #1 &amp; # 6 , the directions were right on. Gwen loved the bridge and walked slowly taking in all of the sights. I on the other hand was sweating profusely and kept my vision directly in front of me keeping up a good pace. Heights are definitely not my strong suit, but with the added grill work on top of the cement structure I was able to finish the hunt with out a panic run back to the car. The stamp for # 6 was really neat as on first glance I thought you had carved an image of the tree, then the true image popped out. We were first in at # 6 but # 1 has had several visitors.<br/>
