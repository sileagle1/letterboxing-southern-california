<br/>
Just my two cents, but here's what I would recommend, from "gotta have" to "probably check out":<br/>
<br/>
Point Vicente Lighthouse - The oldest box in the area and a great view!<br/>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=3152<br/>
<br/>
Moonlight Rider - Cool stamp and recent Box Of The Week winner!<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/boxes/clue/?gBoxId=127847<br/>
<br/>
Lanfill Looop Trail Series - Nice easy hike.<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/boxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=102053<br/>
<br/>
Peaceful Garden - Nicest box of the several in this park.<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/boxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=101891<br/>
<br/>
Reservoir Dogs - Not too shy to toot my own horn.<br/>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=44957<br/>
<br/>
Little Whale Watch - Many locals don't even know about this one.<br/>
http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/California.html#Box_220<br/>
<br/>
Da Blimp! - Get a box and maybe take a ride!<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/boxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=90410<br/>
<br/>
Pirates Treasure - #2 is also at Point Vicente.<br/>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=23768<br/>
<br/>
Andy's Box - Dedicated to a fallen soldier.<br/>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=45730<br/>
<br/>
South Coast Botanical Letterbox - Only one in the area I don't have.<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=124329<br/>
<br/>
Marsh Preserve - Nice place, but probably pretty wet right now.<br/>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=44962<br/>
<br/>
C Over D - Cute and easy.<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/boxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=108529<br/>
<br/>
The Shipwreck Trail - Might be missing, but probably just hard to find.<br/>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=3155<br/>
<br/>
The Palos Verdes Peninsula Picture Puzzle - I just planted this one, and after doing all these others, you just may have covered enough ground to figure this one out.<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=51715<br/>
<br/>
That's a good selection.  Anyone want to add or subtract from that list?<br/>

PS  I just wish the Abalone Cove boxes, my San Pedro Series, and the Manhattan Beach Pier were still active.  Alas.<br/>

Saturday PBandJ will checking on whether Peaceful Garden is still "alive" or not as the garden was pretty shorn, and all rocks exposed when I was there ???  We are both hoping I was totally in the wrong place :-{<br/>

Hi there, met with PBandJ today and sad to say - "Peaceful Garden" is definitely MIA :-(<br/>
She wanted me to let everybody know she went ahead and Retired "Dan" (The Fly) of the Pond Friend series.  She says she has no idea how it ended up where it was, and assumed it was missing like the others and thought it pretty funny that it resurfaced after all this time :-)<br/>
