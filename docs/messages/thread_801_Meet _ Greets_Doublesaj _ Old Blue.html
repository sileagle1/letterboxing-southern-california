Sadly, living & working in San Diego, I won't be able to meet with them.  But if there is anyone who can make it would they mind saying hello from Tara (formerly Lowry)??? I met them once or twice when I lived up in the Bay Area--very nice boxers!<br>

Hi Tara,<br>
My friend, Katie and I have been very busy planting boxes in San Diego County. As a matter of fact, we're going out to Cabrillo Point today to plant 2 more boxes.<br>
San Diego seems to be lacking in much activity lately. I do hope that you can get out and find some of our plants (and anyone else who wants to visit our fair city!).<br>
PS: we are planning an event for early next year and would be thrilled to have you join us.<br>
