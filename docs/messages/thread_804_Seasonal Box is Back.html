La Canada Flintridge ( pronounced Can-yah-da ) is right next to Pasadena on the northwest, just past the Rose Bowl. That's the reason for the New Year's theme- and it's a much quieter spot for a letterbox than Pasadena this time of year! ;-)<br>

I wish!  But thanks to Alarch telling me about Swain's in Glendale, I finally got a new supply of pink stuff recently, so that's why I've been putting out some new plants.<br>
<br>
But I DID get an awesome Christmas present!  My wife and two kids planted a letterbox for me and then hid the clues inside a gift!  How cool is that?<br>
