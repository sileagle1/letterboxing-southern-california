<br/>
The Angel Atop The Christmas Tree.<br/>
<br/>
Many folks wonder how it came to pass that on many Christmas trees the little angel has replaced the star on the top of the tree. This story will give you a new insight to the root cause of this change. <br/>
Many years ago Santa was at the very end of his rope. He was just a few weeks away from Christmas and he was way behind in all of his preparations. One morning he woke up later than usual and realized that he failed to set his alarm clock. He looked over and found Mrs. Claus still sleeping beside him. Santa shook his dear wife and asked her why she wasn't up fixing his breakfast. She replied" Hey fatso, I'm sleeping in today!"<br/>
Santa got out of bed and went to the closet for one of his Santa suits and found there was none hanging in his closet. Mrs. Claus told him to dig one out of the dirty close hamper and just make do. Santa stumbled down the stairs and into the kitchen, where he burned his toast and scalded his tongue on his hot chocolate. Just as he was cooling his mouth down one of his elves burst into the kitchen screaming," The Reindeer broke out of their pen!" Santa immediately ran out of the backdoor and slipped and fell into a huge pile of reindeer poo mixed with mud. After rounding up the reindeer Santa went back up stairs for a shower, but to his dismay there was no hot water. After his cold shower he put on the next cleanest Santa suit and headed off to the workshop. Upon entering the workshop he found all of his elves sitting around munching on cookies and drinking hot chocolate. He was so upset he couldn't speak, when finally one elf came up to him and told Santa that they had formed a union, he was the union steward, and they were on one of their many coffee breaks. It was just about this time when the little angel came into the workshop dragging a tree and asked," Santa, where do you want me to put this?"<br/>
