  Tomorrow (Saturday), I have a date with my husband to go kayaking in the canals at Venice, CA. We'll be trying out my hubby's "new" two-man kayak. (I've never been in a kayak before!)<br>

Golden Gecko  had a couple of boxes that were accessible by water only. Unfortunately, she recently pulled all her boxes and clues.   Hopefully someone else knows something.<br>
<br>
Kayaking is a lot of fun!   My only other suggestion is if you plan to visit a box, don't take your entire journal. =-)  Just paper to stamp on, and glue it into your book when you're back on dry land. Kayaks sit low in the water so they tend to get a bit sloshy.  <br>
Have a good time!<br>

If there was one in Venice that you had to use a kayak I think Gwen would have known about it. She is the kayaker.<br>

I think I probably still have the clues lying around here.  If anyone is going kayaking in Alamitos Bay I can probably dig them up, might be worth a shot.  They were clever clues and nice stamps. <br>

What do you think... since you've been there?  (Don't want to mess up my 15th anniversary outing by falling in the water.)<br>

Some  of the Golden Gecko's boxes required 'standing up' in the kayak and both  the Heron and Tinman and Heron Two required exiting the kayak and a short walk to the boxes. Heron Two, Plumbing Problem have docks where you can exit. Heron and Tinman do require a shore landing.<br>

As it turned out, we got too late a start, to include letterboxing.<br>
Finally left "grandma's house," where we dropped the kids off,<br>
at 2pm... so that didn't leave a lot of time.<br>
Decided to keep it simpler and go back to "Plan A" -- where we kayaked in the canals at Venice for a little over an hour.<br>
Had a great time...<br>
Didn't see anyplace that cried out for kayaking letterboxes to be planted...<br>
<br>
Discovered a FABULOUS (not atmosphere, but service & food) Mediterranean restaurant there in Venice, near the pier:<br>
"Gaby's Mediterranean" -- highly recommended.<br>
<br>
Will try kayaking and letterboxing in the Long Beach neighborhood another time...<br>
<br>
Thanks again!<br>
