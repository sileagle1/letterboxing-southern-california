So I took my daughter down to CSULB yesterday, and since she was going<br>
to be several hours (new job) - I thought I would kill time by doing a<br>
little LBing in between the sprinkles - HA!<br>
<br>
After checking out the wrong location on one LB in Seal Beach - I<br>
decided to try out another, one closer to the water . . . about that<br>
time God gave Noah the heads up on the ARK design and the deluge began.<br>
<br>
I was able to travel from Seal Beach Blvd. to the 405 and onto the<br>
22/7th street exit by sheer nerve, white knuckles, and lots of squinting<br>
and prayers.<br>
<br>
I thought if I could just make it back to CSULB, I could take refuge in<br>
the campus parking lot - down by the kids' dorm, and wait out the<br>
storm -boy was I wrong!<br>
<br>
After turning onto W. Campus Drive I immediately realized I had made a<br>
mistake . . . they should have named it W. River Drain.<br>
<br>
The workers by the poof ball waterfall (my son's name for the fountains<br>
on campus that look like - well - poof balls) were working frantically<br>
trying to keep the deluge water from flowing over the curb and into the<br>
Admin. Bldg. while directing traffic around their equipment and,<br>
subsequently, had me turn and head back up stream.<br>
<br>
Which went pretty well until I hit 7th Street again.<br>
<br>
In the few minutes I was gone, navigating the river on campus, the<br>
waters had risen and a lake was now in front of the Veteran's Hospital!<br>
<br>
I was so glad to see folks keeping their heads and moving slowly! Whew.<br>
<br>
  I was able to motor slowly across and touch dry asphalt in the turn<br>
lane - and, since the turn lane was dry, I turned.<br>
<br>
I made my way into the Ralph's Center parking lot where I sought out<br>
high ground and waited.<br>
<br>
I was just considering climbing into the back and knocking out for a<br>
little while - when what to my wondering eyes should appear??  Blue Sky!<br>
<br>
Hmmmmmmm, I pondered, should I at least try and find one of Kelsung's<br>
while waiting??<br>
<br>
So off down Bellflower I ventured . . . . . Neither rain, nor flood, nor<br>
tornado (well, maybe the tornado) shall keep this LBer from her<br>
appointed find.<br>
<br>
I've lost it, I know :-P<br>
<br>
The most amazing thing was, that by the time I went back to pick my<br>
daughter up, all the water was gone!  Even the lake in front of the Vets<br>
Hospital had vanished???<br>
<br>
Amazing things - drains . . .hmmmm.  What I want to know is  who<br>
pulled the plug?<br>

    Having grown up in the Long Beach area and all of those you mention being my old stomping grounds....I found your letter helarious.  But once again knowing the area I know what it is like there during down pours and know very well the stress some of it may have caused.  I'm glad you made it around without flooding your engine which I have done in that area in the past.  However my old beater at the time was a 66 Ford Falcon and it flooded easily. lol<br>

    Definately a memory you'll be able to share forever.  :-)  <br>

I just hope all our Lobing friends, and family, that live in those areas are safe - we got a call CSULB closed their Campus - no doubt!<br>
My daughter says water was streaming into the bookstore and had almost come in the front door of the art store.  I have to take her back this Saturday and am hoping to forgo yesterday's experiences :-P<br>
As I'm writing this I'm looking out the window and watching the white stuff piling up in the yard - <br>
I planted two LB's this last weekend - and I'm hoping they haven't washed away :-(<br>

Thanks Old Roar!  <br>
I just hope all our Lobing friends, and family, that live in those areas are safe - we got a call CSULB closed their Campus - no doubt!<br>
My daughter says water was streaming into the bookstore and had almost come in the front door of the art store.  I have to take her back this Saturday and am hoping to forgo yesterday's experiences :-P<br>
As I'm writing this I'm looking out the window and watching the white stuff piling up in the yard - <br>
I planted two LB's this last weekend - and I'm hoping they haven't washed away :-(<br>

So I took my daughter down to CSULB yesterday, and since she was going<br>
to be several hours (new job) - I thought I would kill time by doing a<br>
little LBing in between the sprinkles - HA!<br>
<br>
After checking out the wrong location on one LB in Seal Beach - I<br>
decided to try out another, one closer to the water . . . about that<br>
time God gave Noah the heads up on the ARK design and the deluge began.<br>
<br>
I was able to travel from Seal Beach Blvd. to the 405 and onto the<br>
22/7th street exit by sheer nerve, white knuckles, and lots of squinting<br>
and prayers.<br>
<br>
I thought if I could just make it back to CSULB, I could take refuge in<br>
the campus parking lot - down by the kids' dorm, and wait out the<br>
storm -boy was I wrong!<br>
<br>
After turning onto W. Campus Drive I immediately realized I had made a<br>
mistake . . . they should have named it W. River Drain.<br>
<br>
The workers by the poof ball waterfall (my son's name for the fountains<br>
on campus that look like - well - poof balls) were working frantically<br>
trying to keep the deluge water from flowing over the curb and into the<br>
Admin. Bldg. while directing traffic around their equipment and,<br>
subsequently, had me turn and head back up stream.<br>
<br>
Which went pretty well until I hit 7th Street again.<br>
<br>
In the few minutes I was gone, navigating the river on campus, the<br>
waters had risen and a lake was now in front of the Veteran's Hospital!<br>
<br>
I was so glad to see folks keeping their heads and moving slowly! Whew.<br>
<br>
I was able to motor slowly across and touch dry asphalt in the turn<br>
lane - and, since the turn lane was dry, I turned.<br>
<br>
I made my way into the Ralph's Center parking lot where I sought out<br>
high ground and waited.<br>
<br>
I was just considering climbing into the back and knocking out for a<br>
little while - when what to my wondering eyes should appear?? Blue Sky!<br>
<br>
Hmmmmmmm, I pondered, should I at least try and find one of Kelsung's<br>
while waiting??<br>
<br>
So off down Bellflower I ventured . . . . . Neither rain, nor flood, nor<br>
tornado (well, maybe the tornado) shall keep this LBer from her<br>
appointed find.<br>
<br>
