You were the second finder for the Stagecoach at Beale's Cut and Desertratty was #1.<br>

I still remember our second find. We drove to Thousand Oaks for Circle X Ranch. Not many choices then. That one had been planted almost a year before we were FF.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think the number of drive-bys get found quick just because it isn't too much out of the way to go after one.  But the one's that take a hike require a bit more planning.  With so many choices, those get pushed to the back burner, so to speak.<br>
<br>
I've been actively working against that mentality lately.  That's why today I found Lee & Nancy's two very cool Lost Lake boxes, and they've only had 7 or 8 finders since 2005.<br>
<br>
Coming soon on my to-do list is The Franklin Canyon Series.  Will they be there?  Who knows, but I'm certainly going to find out.<br>
