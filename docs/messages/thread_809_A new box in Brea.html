When Sharon and I were first married (37+ years ago), we lived in Brea, and used to drive both the 57 and Brea Canyon Road fairly often.  When I was a lad, I attended several Scouting events at the camps back in those hills.  It will be fun to get another look at the area, whenever that happens :-)<br/>
