Yep, it was your crew of boxers at the bridge. <br/>
Who gets to hold the clue sheet? Who gets to go for the box?  Who stamps in first?  Don and I frequently clash when boxing; his paces take him much further than mine and he often doesn't want to sit around and study the log book like I like to.  So you must have a system when it comes to seeking boxes.  I wish we would have had time to work at more of Buzzard's boxes in Paso but perhaps next time. Let us know when you all complete the series.  Good luck.<br/>
