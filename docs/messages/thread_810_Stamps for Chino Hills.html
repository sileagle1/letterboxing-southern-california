The girls and I will make a stamp.  We haven't done any carving yet so please let us know what everyone is making.  The youngest said she could do an animal or a tree. But if you're doing the desert theme than can it be a cactus, snake? LMK so I can get her started.  I'm sorry I haven't been on, everything is behind, not just email but house, life etc. I don't get sick often but when I do I'm down for the count.  <br>
I don't know about the other meet up but I'll have to see when we get closer.<br>

I already have the box for the plant and the supplies for everything else. <br>

I think the only specific animal/plant mentioned has been Desertratty's kangaroo rat, so you should have your pick since you're starting early.  :-)<br>
I have to keep reminding myself that March will be here soon!  <br>
Hope you're feeling better!<br>

Sorry to hear you've been sick!  Lots of that going around.<br>
I think the only specific animal/plant mentioned has been Desertratty's kangaroo rat, so you should have your pick since you're starting early.  :-)<br>
I have to keep reminding myself that March will be here soon!  <br>
Hope you're feeling better!<br>
