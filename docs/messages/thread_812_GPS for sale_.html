                    <div class="plaintext-content">Howdy folks.  I've been long absent from the board, apologies apologies, but I've been working a whole lot at a new job.<br/>

This isn't the triumphant return I hoped for, but it'll have to do.  After much thought I have decided to sell my trusty GPS.  I have had for a while, used it a fair amount but recently have found it sitting in the closet on top of a pile of camping gear, sad and alone.<br/>
<br/>
So here's the scoop.  I was going to stick it on eBay, but I hate eBay.  I was going to put it on craigslist but I thought that I would see if anyone of my fellow SoCal Letterboxers would like to buy it.  It's a Garmin GPSMAP 60CSx, a great unit that has a load of features.  More info on it can be found here:<br/>

<br/>
It's great for hiking, camping, backpacking, letterboxing and (gasp!  dare I say it) geocaching.  I was going to ask $240 on CL, but I'd take $220 from a boxer.  Anyone out there interested, let me know - <br/>
