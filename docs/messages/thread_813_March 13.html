                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went and checked out the park a couple weeks ago, and there are many entrances, but only one road into the park; and that is at its northeast corner off Jasmine.  It goes in about 3.5 miles to a campground and ranger station (the old rolling M ranch).  At 3 miles in there is a small cluster of picnic tables (3), that might be a good spot.  The only other place was up at the old ranch - Kelsung will let us know where.  I plan to plant a series of drive-bys along the road in and possibly extend into a short hike, for those not able to do the long hikes.  The park has been closed to ALL use since the heavy rains (including those who sneak in on foot - I was caught by the ranger on my way out - luckily no citation), and was still closed yesterday when I drove by, but it looked like they had been grading the road, getting it ready to open.  There are trails that go the entire 8 mile width of the park, but there are also much shorter loops available.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of packing a lunch and maybe share a snack (dessert or fruit).  There are only 3 tables at first location, and the area is a bit primative (one porta-potty).  There are better restrooms available at the Ranch/Ranger Station .5 miles up a paved road (It is a dirt road most of the way in).  At the Ranch there looked to be about 20+ tables, but they were all together in one group, like you reserved them?  And you would be under the constant eye "The Man".  Maps and brochere of the park can be found at:<br>

There is an $8 day use fee per vehicle, and you may want to bring exact change, in case the shack is not manned, and you have to use the drop box envelope.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lee has hit most of the information here, so I'll just flesh it out a little, and add this to the AQ event listing:<br>
<br>
Exit the 71 freeway at Soquel Canyon Parkway and go southwest.  Go left at the fourth intersection, which is Cypress Point Dr/Elinvar Dr.  It will end at Sapphire Rd, so turn left, then immediately right into the park entrance, which is a dirt road.  Take this back about a mile to where you will pay the $8 fee, then continue another 1.5 miles, at which point the dirt will become paved.<br>
<br>
Now, right there are two picnic tables and only five parking spaces, but it will be the starting point to all the loops I'm planning.  If you continue a short distance further, there are three more picnic tables and more parking, and some of the hikes can start or end there, instead.  Between these two areas, we should have ample room.<br>
<br>
Beyond this it reaches the ranch, and although the facilities there are nice, they do require reservations and fees.  I believe that will probably be the starting point to Mr. Ospitals series.<br>
<br>
What I've finally decided to do is actually create 5 short loops that all start and end in the same area, and also intersect one another, so they can be combined into a couple medium hikes, or all strung together into one long hike.  That way, any level hiker can be satisfied.<br>
<br>
But be warned, even the "short" hikes aren't easy.  Chino Hills is beautiful grassy hills, but that means little to no shade, and lots of good inclines.  And some of the trails, although clearly marked, are little more than an unmaintained footpath.  Bring good hiking shoes, sunscreen and water.<br>
<br>
I figure we meet in the morning for the event stamp and exchanges, I hand everyone a packet of clues, and we break up into groups who each take a different short loop.  Then at the end, we meet back up for lunch where you bring your own sandwich and drinks, and something potluck to share: chips/cookies/fruit/etc.<br>
<br>
After lunch, anyone still up for it can go off on another short/medium/long hike.<br>

  Lee has hit most of the information here, so I'll just flesh it out a little, and add this to the AQ event listing:<br>
<br>
  Exit the 71 freeway at Soquel Canyon Parkway and go southwest. Go left at the fourth intersection, which is Cypress Point Dr/Elinvar Dr. It will end at Sapphire Rd, so turn left, then immediately right into the park entrance, which is a dirt road. Take this back about a mile to where you will pay the $8 fee, then continue another 1.5 miles, at which point the dirt will become paved.<br>
<br>
  Now, right there are two picnic tables and only five parking spaces, but it will be the starting point to all the loops I'm planning. If you continue a short distance further, there are three more picnic tables and more parking, and some of the hikes can start or end there, instead. Between these two areas, we should have ample room.<br>
<br>
  Beyond this it reaches the ranch, and although the facilities there are nice, they do require reservations and fees. I believe that will probably be the starting point to Mr. Ospitals series.<br>
<br>
  What I've finally decided to do is actually create 5 short loops that all start and end in the same area, and also intersect one another, so they can be combined into a couple medium hikes, or all strung together into one long hike. That way, any level hiker can be satisfied.<br>
<br>
  But be warned, even the "short" hikes aren't easy. Chino Hills is beautiful grassy hills, but that means little to no shade, and lots of good inclines. And some of the trails, although clearly marked, are little more than an unmaintained footpath. Bring good hiking shoes, sunscreen and water.<br>
<br>
  I figure we meet in the morning for the event stamp and exchanges, I hand everyone a packet of clues, and we break up into groups who each take a different short loop. Then at the end, we meet back up for lunch where you bring your own sandwich and drinks, and something potluck to share: chips/cookies/fruit/etc.<br>
<br>
  After lunch, anyone still up for it can go off on another short/medium/long hike.<br>

Just an FYI, I probably won't hike much, so if anyone out there feels like just hanging out while others are breaking their backs... Don't worry, you won't be alone. :-)<br>

Not much shade in the park, most of the trees were all burned.  However all the tables mentioned (the two Kelsung mentioned, and the three further down) all have a cover over them for some shade (at least on one side).  Most of the tables in the Equestrian staging area are un-covered.  I uploaded a photo of one of the tables and the lack of shade.<br>
