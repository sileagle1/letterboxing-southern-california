I was so close to attempting to find the Burro Schmidt LB, I could taste it . .. . I mean, we were camped just seven miles down the road - THEE road that goes up there - but my son was too spooked by the sand to try for it on his motorcycle . . . . and his Dad didn't want to scratch his truck driving up there :-( ah well - it was a gorgeous day - but I think it would have been hard to go for it anyway as the place seemed to be getting lots of traffic.<br/>
Was going to try for the one at Jawbone, but the crew had an agenda to get to Carl's Jr. in Mojave,<br/>
and with our rig, and the band playing at the "store", I don't think we could have stopped - oh well - next time!<br/>
