Also, in seeing several new sign-ups on AQ, I'm thinking people might want to contact each other about carpooling in.  There is a lot of street parking at the entrance, so you could leave one car, catch a ride in and split the $8 so we don't run out of parking at the site.  Just thinking proactively.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the offers to help! Atlas, however, has some serious separation anxiety issues and would cry the entire time if we left her with a (semi-) stranger while we went hiking. We'll figure out what to do - either bring her and stay in the gathering area or leave her at home and stay for a shorter time. I've never understood why dogs aren't allowed in specific parts of some parks. It's quite frustrating.<br>
<br>
Kelsung, is there anything that BuffaloTony and I can do to help you?<br>
