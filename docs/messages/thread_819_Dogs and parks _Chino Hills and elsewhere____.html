Basically, it comes down to three things: a) your dog's safety, b) protecting the natural environment, and c) the stupidity of a few people.<br>
<br>
The first part is easy.  Almost any wilderness area has places where a dog can get into real trouble.  Wild animals, especially rattlesnakes, can be a real danger to a dog, even one on a leash.  I've seen it happen, and it isn't pretty.  And if a dog is off leash, the dangers increase many-fold.  Also, dogs tend to get into things that can make them sick: pack-rat nests, squirrel holes, etc.  These harbor animal droppings which can carry all kinds of diseases.<br>
<br>
The second part is almost as easy.  Dogs carry disease that might not actually affect them, but *can* affect wild animals.  It's the reverse of the last two sentences of the above paragraph.  Sure; humans can carry diseases, too, but we aren't as likely to stick our nose into a rat's nest :-p<br>
<br>
Which brings us to the third part.  No matter how many signs are put up, no matter how many warnings are posted, there are always a few bloody idiots who refuse to believe that their precious Poopsie's poop can be dangerous, so they never clean it up.  They cannot believe that their dear companion Muttley could ever attack another dog, or a deer, or a squirrel, so they refuse to put him on a leash.  I could go on, but you get the idea.  All it takes is one jackass to ruin things for everyone else, and there are plenty of jackasses in the world :-(  So, many parks just forbid *any* dogs, rather than try to set up rules.  In most cases, they tried setting up rules, but one or two fools refused to follow them, and a dog died, or a whole bunch of wild animals got sick, so now the park just flat outlaws dogs completely.  A shame, but I've seen the direct effects of stupidity, and I've even chewed out people for not following the rules (being a volunteer has a few perks ;-), so I support the dog bans.  I certainly would not want my dog hurt because of another dog owner's bad actions.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

I'm sorry Atlas won't be able to join in, she is such a well mannered girl :-) but, alas, as you say - the "jackasses" ruin it for everybody :-(<br>
However, watch what you say about rat's nests!!!<br>

Yes there are quite a few bloody idiots in this world lol.  My neighbors dogs get out constantly and where do they go, the front of my property every time and they aren't little poopers they are big poopers.  And it's the bloody itdiots that ruin things for those that are respectful.<br>
<br>
I'd make her clean it up but she's elderly.<br>
