Purchased stamps are perfectly acceptable. You might want to chose <br>
ones that fit the theme of your letterbox, but not doing this is <br>
okay too.  There are no rules in letterboxing; just have fun.<br>

Well, the challenge was for folks on the list who live in So. Cal. to plant <br>
at least one box in So. Cal before Jan. 1.  I think it's a bonus that someone <br>
on the list who is not a resident of So. Cal. planted a box/boxes in THEIR <br>
area!  <chanting>: "More boxes, more boxes, more boxes!"<br>
<br>
Your historical series sounds fascinating.  I think it would be great to have <br>
related boxes in our area to continue the story.  What a draw when we have a <br>
gathering down here!  (Hint, hint for Buzzard) Folks to the north can hit the <br>
Kern Co. boxes on their way here or on the way home.<br>

We already have numerous boxes in Seal/Long Beach areas as we still keep an apt. open for our beach visits, so we still are a 15% resident of SoCal. We probably won't have much opportunity for planting another "real" SoCal box prior to 1/1/2004 so we can't meet the challenge. We are planning at least two in the Ventura/Santa Barbara area over Thanksgiving but neither of them pertain to Vasquez.  This guy really got around so continuation of his story through out California is a great idea.<br>
