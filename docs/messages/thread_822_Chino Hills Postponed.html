Also... since I've been to Glendora but never up into the foothills (how many in your party?), maybe we can meet at an easier place to find, and then carpool?  So far, you're the only one who's responded favorably to my suggestion for Saturday.<br/>

&gt; Hi! We are in San Diego until next Wed. We are going to do Disney on Sunday. We have a hotel near there on Saturday night and Sunday night. We worked our schedule around so that we could make the event on Saturday. We have tried a few boxes here with no luck. Most have been washed away with all the rain they have received lately. :( Would you be able to meet up with hansenclan and go boxing too? I recognize your trail name. I was thinking that we exchanged, but maybe not. I met so many people there! <br/>

Lisa - I was down in Oceanside about two weeks ago, and I know what you mean about boxes getting washed away!  <br/>
I wish I could make it down to Glendora, let me talk with RAV and see what she has to say about possibly coming down that way - as for the Con, unfortunately I started the trip pooped out before I ever left CA., and by the time I got home everything was a blur! :-P  <br/>
I still haven't logged my finds, and recently, while emptying out a bag, I came across some "cooties" I had carried all the way back with me and didn't know about!! <br/>
Talking about feeling like a big dummy!  It sure was a blast though, wasn't it?<br/>
I remember your name as well, but you know, I would be sitting there talking with folks and totally forget to exchange!  So, if we did meet, there's a good chance we never did get around to exchanging!!! <br/>
I wish I had Southern Oracle's energy - I think she went to every event, found every box, got all the PT's, Event Boxes and made every exchange!!<br/>
 <br/>
Note:  I finished this and sent it out last night, but evidently my computer fairy struck again and it somehow deleted????  I checked the yahoo site and it's not there and it's not in my sent file either???  Well, I know I finished it in a clever way before hitting send last night, but for the life of me, I can't remember what I said, and all I have is this partial "draft" that was automatically saved in my draft file??<br/>
Anyway - I heard back from RAV and we'll be able to come!!  Please send info. as to the when and where - hopefully the evil computer fairies won't steal it before I see it :-]<br/>
No wonder Hansenclan thought no one else had responded!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh, I would! since I am here only for this weekend, all the way from Iowa, I was devastated to hear that the event is postponed! :( I would love to still be able to do some boxing and meet some of you!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just tell me when and where to meet you. I am staying with my sister in San Diego, so I will be driving up from there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Would any who planned on attending the Chino Hills gathering, care to join me Saturday in looking for the "Lost in the Wilderness" series in the Glendora foothills (Glendora Wilderness Park)?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In my opinion, wilderness parks are best "done" in a crowd... or at least, at group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Say... 9:30 or so? The more, the merrier!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; As some of you know, the weather has been against us. I've had high hopes that things would be okay by the time of the event. But I now have it on a strong authority (a park ranger) that Chino Hills State Park will most likely be closed this weekend. Therefore, I think we need to postpone the gathering for the following Saturday, the 20th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; They had a bulldozer level roads a few weeks ago and opened one weekend, but it apparently was decided that they want to make sure all of them are clear before opening again. Although they may get that done this week, the goal is to have it done for next week. The weather forecast has no more rain in it, so everything will be fine for the 20th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I realize this is pretty last minute, but they were hoping as much as me. The rangers don't like having the park closed anymore than the rest of us. I know some of you may not be able to make it on the 20th instead, and I'm truly sorry. But I don't want to have 40+ folks showing up to a locked gate this weekend.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My bigger worry is that not everyone planning to come will get the message, so please help spread the news. I think we can still have a successful event on the 20th.<br/>

Looks like my husband came along and made plans for the weekend behind me - so now, after I drop RAV off I have to drive up to the Shafter area - I think that's the name.  Are you going to join us on Saturday Kelsung??<br/>

It is a pretty short hike, maybe a mile. The last box is along the road on the return. It took me about an hour.<br/>

&gt; Hi Lisa... not ignoring you... I just need to work out some details. If you e-mail me at 8hands4jesus@ dslextreme. com, we can exchange cell numbers, for last-minute communication. For starters, I'm guessing you won't leave the house before 8am, bringing you into my area about 10am or so. Does that sound feasible to you? Also... since I've been to Glendora but never up into the foothills (how many in your party?), maybe we can meet at an easier place to find, and then carpool? So far, you're the only one who's responded favorably to my suggestion for Saturday.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi! We are in San Diego until next Wed. We are going to do Disney on Sunday. We have a hotel near there on Saturday night and Sunday night. We worked our schedule around so that we could make the event on Saturday. We have tried a few boxes here with no luck. Most have been washed away with all the rain they have received lately. :( Would you be able to meet up with hansenclan and go boxing too? I recognize your trail name. I was thinking that we exchanged, but maybe not. I met so many people there! <br/>

As of right now I don't know.  I can come with the youngest but I am so drained right now I don't really know what I will be like this weekend.  Tomorrow hubby has his ultra sound in the morning and in the afternoon I have to take her in to see an ortho dr.  She isn't casted yet just has a splint.  <br/>

If I don't make it I wish everyone to have a great time.  If it does get pushed another week I will try and make that.<br/>

I have to look back at what he said this last 2 or 3 weeks has been a blurr.  I feel terrible we couldn't go but with the one having a full leg cast on she's been ordered not to put any weight on it for 3 to 4 months.  She's to ride around in a wheel chair for the next 4 weeks.  And with a full leg cast she's not having fun.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I could leave her with hubby but that's just not possible. lol  I did and he left to go get the other two from school and took forever.  He did not put a phone by her and did not take his phone.  I was a bit upset and just figured I will do the caring for totally.  lol  She has been feeling alot better these last two nights.  However the first 2 or 3  were really bad.  Which in your case is a baby, mine is 14 lol.  <br/>

Get some rest and fix that tire.  <br/>

Well, obviously we're not going to make it, it's 10:30, I just got out of the shower, lol. The car still has a leaky tire, so it's at the tire place, plus the baby would NOT go to sleep last night, so it was a very late morning. Maybe I'll just plan a gather for this fall... You guys be up for another one, out here near San Bernardino, once the summer stops being so hot?<br/>
<br/>
Hope you're all having fun!<br/>

That's ok Beach Celt I couldn't make it either. With my husband having the mini stroke and than my daughter having a fractured femer and the growth plate being broken, because the dang dog rammed her. And Holly &amp; I finally finished her stamp but she thought she was to burry it. Kelsung said she could make it a travler of sorts. I have to look back at what he said this last 2 or 3 weeks has been a blurr. I feel terrible we couldn't go but with the one having a full leg cast on she's been ordered not to put any weight on it for 3 to 4 months. She's to ride around in a wheel chair for the next 4 weeks. And with a full leg cast she's not having fun.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I could leave her with hubby but that's just not possible. lol I did and he left to go get the other two from school and took forever. He did not put a phone by her and did not take his phone. I was a bit upset and just figured I will do the caring for totally. lol She has been feeling alot better these last two nights. However the first 2 or 3 were really bad. Which in your case is a baby, mine is 14 lol. <br/>
<br/>
Get some rest and fix that tire. <br/>
