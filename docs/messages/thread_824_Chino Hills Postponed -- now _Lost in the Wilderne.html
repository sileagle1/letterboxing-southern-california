&gt; Hi Lisa... not ignoring you... I just need to work out some details. If you e-mail me at 8hands4jesus@ dslextreme. com, we can exchange cell numbers, for last-minute communication. For starters, I'm guessing you won't leave the house before 8am, bringing you into my area about 10am or so. Does that sound feasible to you? Also... since I've been to Glendora but never up into the foothills (how many in your party?), maybe we can meet at an easier place to find, and then carpool? So far, you're the only one who's responded favorably to my suggestion for Saturday.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi! We are in San Diego until next Wed. We are going to do Disney on Sunday. We have a hotel near there on Saturday night and Sunday night. We worked our schedule around so that we could make the event on Saturday. We have tried a few boxes here with no luck. Most have been washed away with all the rain they have received lately. :( Would you be able to meet up with hansenclan and go boxing too? I recognize your trail name. I was thinking that we exchanged, but maybe not. I met so many people there! <br/>

&gt; &gt; Would any who planned on attending the Chino Hills gathering, care to join me Saturday in looking for the "Lost in the Wilderness" series in the Glendora foothills (Glendora Wilderness Park)?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In my opinion, wilderness parks are best "done" in a crowd... or at least, at group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Say... 9:30 or so? The more, the merrier!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; As some of you know, the weather has been against us. I've had high hopes that things would be okay by the time of the event. But I now have it on a strong authority (a park ranger) that Chino Hills State Park will most likely be closed this weekend. Therefore, I think we need to postpone the gathering for the following Saturday, the 20th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; They had a bulldozer level roads a few weeks ago and opened one weekend, but it apparently was decided that they want to make sure all of them are clear before opening again. Although they may get that done this week, the goal is to have it done for next week. The weather forecast has no more rain in it, so everything will be fine for the 20th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I realize this is pretty last minute, but they were hoping as much as me. The rangers don't like having the park closed anymore than the rest of us. I know some of you may not be able to make it on the 20th instead, and I'm truly sorry. But I don't want to have 40+ folks showing up to a locked gate this weekend.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My bigger worry is that not everyone planning to come will get the message, so please help spread the news. I think we can still have a successful event on the 20th.<br/>

Hi Lee &amp; Nancy...<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that a good meeting place would be Denny's restaurant -- on Baseline at Grand Avenue (immediately north of the 210 Freeway).  I haven't looked up the address yet, but it's in Glendora.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Lisa... not ignoring you... I just need to work out some details. If you e-mail me at 8hands4jesus@ dslextreme. com, we can exchange cell numbers, for last-minute communication. For starters, I'm guessing you won't leave the house before 8am, bringing you into my area about 10am or so. Does that sound feasible to you? Also... since I've been to Glendora but never up into the foothills (how many in your party?), maybe we can meet at an easier place to find, and then carpool? So far, you're the only one who's responded favorably to my suggestion for Saturday.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi! We are in San Diego until next Wed. We are going to do Disney on Sunday. We have a hotel near there on Saturday night and Sunday night. We worked our schedule around so that we could make the event on Saturday. We have tried a few boxes here with no luck. Most have been washed away with all the rain they have received lately. :( Would you be able to meet up with hansenclan and go boxing too? I recognize your trail name. I was thinking that we exchanged, but maybe not. I met so many people there! <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would any who planned on attending the Chino Hills gathering, care to join me Saturday in looking for the "Lost in the Wilderness" series in the Glendora foothills (Glendora Wilderness Park)?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, wilderness parks are best "done" in a crowd... or at least, at group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Say... 9:30 or so? The more, the merrier!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As some of you know, the weather has been against us. I've had high hopes that things would be okay by the time of the event. But I now have it on a strong authority (a park ranger) that Chino Hills State Park will most likely be closed this weekend. Therefore, I think we need to postpone the gathering for the following Saturday, the 20th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They had a bulldozer level roads a few weeks ago and opened one weekend, but it apparently was decided that they want to make sure all of them are clear before opening again. Although they may get that done this week, the goal is to have it done for next week. The weather forecast has no more rain in it, so everything will be fine for the 20th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I realize this is pretty last minute, but they were hoping as much as me. The rangers don't like having the park closed anymore than the rest of us. I know some of you may not be able to make it on the 20th instead, and I'm truly sorry. But I don't want to have 40+ folks showing up to a locked gate this weekend.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My bigger worry is that not everyone planning to come will get the message, so please help spread the news. I think we can still have a successful event on the 20th.<br/>

Hi Lee &amp; Nancy...<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that a good meeting place would be Denny's restaurant -- on Baseline at Grand Avenue (immediately north of the 210 Freeway). I haven't looked up the address yet, but it's in Glendora.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, wilderness parks are best "done" in a crowd... or at least, at group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Say... 9:30 or so? The more, the merrier!<br/>

Hi Lee &amp; Nancy...<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that a good meeting place would be Denny's restaurant -- on Baseline at Grand Avenue (immediately north of the 210 Freeway). I haven't looked up the address yet, but it's in Glendora.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Lisa... not ignoring you... I just need to work out some details. If you e-mail me at 8hands4jesus@ dslextreme. com, we can exchange cell numbers, for last-minute communication. For starters, I'm guessing you won't leave the house before 8am, bringing you into my area about 10am or so. Does that sound feasible to you? Also... since I've been to Glendora but never up into the foothills (how many in your party?), maybe we can meet at an easier place to find, and then carpool? So far, you're the only one who's responded favorably to my suggestion for Saturday.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi! We are in San Diego until next Wed. We are going to do Disney on Sunday. We have a hotel near there on Saturday night and Sunday night. We worked our schedule around so that we could make the event on Saturday. We have tried a few boxes here with no luck. Most have been washed away with all the rain they have received lately. :( Would you be able to meet up with hansenclan and go boxing too? I recognize your trail name. I was thinking that we exchanged, but maybe not. I met so many people there! <br/>

I'm thinking that a good meeting place would be Denny's restaurant -- on Baseline at Grand Avenue (immediately north of the 210 Freeway). I haven't looked up the address yet, but it's in Glendora.<br/>

&gt; I already did the Lost in the Wild series, but still need to get the Downtown Glendora series. If I know when and where you are meeting, I might try to stop by for a quick meet and exchange with HowD.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Lisa... not ignoring you... I just need to work out some details. If you e-mail me at 8hands4jesus@ dslextreme. com, we can exchange cell numbers, for last-minute communication. For starters, I'm guessing you won't leave the house before 8am, bringing you into my area about 10am or so. Does that sound feasible to you? Also... since I've been to Glendora but never up into the foothills (how many in your party?), maybe we can meet at an easier place to find, and then carpool? So far, you're the only one who's responded favorably to my suggestion for Saturday.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi! We are in San Diego until next Wed. We are going to do Disney on Sunday. We have a hotel near there on Saturday night and Sunday night. We worked our schedule around so that we could make the event on Saturday. We have tried a few boxes here with no luck. Most have been washed away with all the rain they have received lately. :( Would you be able to meet up with hansenclan and go boxing too? I recognize your trail name. I was thinking that we exchanged, but maybe not. I met so many people there! <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would any who planned on attending the Chino Hills gathering, care to join me Saturday in looking for the "Lost in the Wilderness" series in the Glendora foothills (Glendora Wilderness Park)?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, wilderness parks are best "done" in a crowd... or at least, at group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Say... 9:30 or so? The more, the merrier!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As some of you know, the weather has been against us. I've had high hopes that things would be okay by the time of the event. But I now have it on a strong authority (a park ranger) that Chino Hills State Park will most likely be closed this weekend. Therefore, I think we need to postpone the gathering for the following Saturday, the 20th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They had a bulldozer level roads a few weeks ago and opened one weekend, but it apparently was decided that they want to make sure all of them are clear before opening again. Although they may get that done this week, the goal is to have it done for next week. The weather forecast has no more rain in it, so everything will be fine for the 20th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I realize this is pretty last minute, but they were hoping as much as me. The rangers don't like having the park closed anymore than the rest of us. I know some of you may not be able to make it on the 20th instead, and I'm truly sorry. But I don't want to have 40+ folks showing up to a locked gate this weekend.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My bigger worry is that not everyone planning to come will get the message, so please help spread the news. I think we can still have a successful event on the 20th.<br/>

&gt; I'll answer myself on that - according to the little guy that runs around at street level on Google - the approx. address is 583 W. Baseline Rd. in Glendora - so, it is not the one that looks like the "Diner" on Baseline and the 210 :-P<br/>
&gt; Is that the right one and are we meeting there at 10:00 am ???<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would any who planned on attending the Chino Hills gathering, care to join me Saturday in looking for the "Lost in the Wilderness" series in the Glendora foothills (Glendora Wilderness Park)?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, wilderness parks are best "done" in a crowd... or at least, at group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Say... 9:30 or so? The more, the merrier!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As some of you know, the weather has been against us. I've had high hopes that things would be okay by the time of the event. But I now have it on a strong authority (a park ranger) that Chino Hills State Park will most likely be closed this weekend. Therefore, I think we need to postpone the gathering for the following Saturday, the 20th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They had a bulldozer level roads a few weeks ago and opened one weekend, but it apparently was decided that they want to make sure all of them are clear before opening again. Although they may get that done this week, the goal is to have it done for next week. The weather forecast has no more rain in it, so everything will be fine for the 20th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I realize this is pretty last minute, but they were hoping as much as me. The rangers don't like having the park closed anymore than the rest of us. I know some of you may not be able to make it on the 20th instead, and I'm truly sorry. But I don't want to have 40+ folks showing up to a locked gate this weekend.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My bigger worry is that not everyone planning to come will get the message, so please help spread the news. I think we can still have a successful event on the 20th.<br/>

I didn't delete as each individual poster can delete their own message, but it really isn't a good idea to post any personal info on a chatlist. Cell phone numbers fall into the personal info category.<br/>

Yahoo chatlist messages can be googled so they are open to the internet.<br/>

You would be surprised how much more info can be obtained by breaking a cell phone number.<br/>

How was your drive north?  (So... did you make dinner after all, or get them to take you out to dinner... or make sure you arrived late enough that they'd already eaten by then?)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">hey there - I drove home to Pearblossom and then got on the road to Taft right around 4:40.  <br/>
At 6:10pm, I was filling up at the 76 Station in Gorman and it was 38 degrees . .. brrrrrrrrrrrr . . . . on the long stretch of darkness into Taft I honestly begin to have doubts about my sanity - and after meeting my husband in the parking lot of a K-mart - in the middle of nowhere - I was really wondering what I was doing when he took off into the darkness and we drove another twenty minutes due West . . .. .then down a rutted out dirt road and into a canyon - where our trailer was the only sign of life - well if you don't count the 3.5 billion frogs/toads that serenaded us through the night.  Dinner was done, and they had eaten,but I was really too tired to care at that point.<br/>
On the bright side, I woke up to wild flowers all around us, and blue skies. <br/>
We had a great time with my husbands cousin, and his son, and we got home safely :-)  So good trip all around - <br/>
 <br/>
NOW for the LB Lesson of the day -<br/>
Did anybody know that our little "Newt" friend (kudos to RAV for correctly identifying the little guy) is TOXIC !!!!!!<br/>
They suggest not handling them with bare hands, and if you do, to wash them right away.<br/>
It is known as the California Newt or Taricha torosa.<br/>
Hopefully no one got sick??  <br/>
So, two lessons:<br/>
1. Leaves of three - let it be (poison oak)<br/>
2. cute orange salamanders are actually newts and they are TOXIC!!!!!  <br/>

You know, Dezertratty, I had that mentioned in my post as I was writing it, but since we had TWO surprises, I deleted the newt mention, so Lee would recognize HIS surprise. (Couldn't figure out at the time how to mention both, cryptically. )<br/>

&gt; Thank you, Don -- the numbers really did come in handy, but now that the event is over, I've deleted the message that held my cell number. I tried to avoid posting my cell by instead posting my email address, so those planning on coming could email me and we could exchange that information privately, but that didn't happen, somehow. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We had a great turnout on short notice: 8 hikers, plus one who came to meet/greet/exchange (and preceded us on the trail, leaving us a surprise, to find later!), and a tenth who planned to come, but ended up unable to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What a beautiful, fun day, with a fun group of people!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to all who came out... and who wanted to....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have a great time Hiking in Chino Hills next weekend. Wish I could be there with you, but today definitely softens the blow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Blessings,<br/>

&gt; &gt; I didn't delete as each individual poster can delete their own message, but it really isn't a good idea to post any personal info on a chatlist. Cell phone numbers fall into the personal info category.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Yahoo chatlist messages can be googled so they are open to the internet.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; You would be surprised how much more info can be obtained by breaking a cell phone number.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; To delet your own message just click on the message and hit the delete button.<br/>
