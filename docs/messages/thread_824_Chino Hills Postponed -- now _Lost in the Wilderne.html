For starters, I'm guessing you won't leave the house before 8am, bringing you into my area about 10am or so. Does that sound feasible to you? Also... since I've been to Glendora but never up into the foothills (how many in your party?), maybe we can meet at an easier place to find, and then carpool? So far, you're the only one who's responded favorably to my suggestion for Saturday.<br>

Hi Lee & Nancy...<br>
<br>
I'm thinking that a good meeting place would be Denny's restaurant -- on Baseline at Grand Avenue (immediately north of the 210 Freeway).  I haven't looked up the address yet, but it's in Glendora.<br>

Hi Lee & Nancy...<br>
<br>
I'm thinking that a good meeting place would be Denny's restaurant -- on Baseline at Grand Avenue (immediately north of the 210 Freeway). I haven't looked up the address yet, but it's in Glendora.<br>

For starters, I'm guessing you won't leave the house before 8am, bringing you into my area about 10am or so. Does that sound feasible to you? Also... since I've been to Glendora but never up into the foothills (how many in your party?), maybe we can meet at an easier place to find, and then carpool? So far, you're the only one who's responded favorably to my suggestion for Saturday.<br>

We worked our schedule around so that we could make the event on Saturday. We have tried a few boxes here with no luck. Most have been washed away with all the rain they have received lately. :( Would you be able to meet up with hansenclan and go boxing too? I recognize your trail name. I was thinking that we exchanged, but maybe not. I met so many people there! <br>

Hi Lee & Nancy...<br>
<br>
I'm thinking that a good meeting place would be Denny's restaurant -- on Baseline at Grand Avenue (immediately north of the 210 Freeway). I haven't looked up the address yet, but it's in Glendora.<br>

For starters, I'm guessing you won't leave the house before 8am, bringing you into my area about 10am or so. Does that sound feasible to you? Also... since I've been to Glendora but never up into the foothills (how many in your party?), maybe we can meet at an easier place to find, and then carpool? So far, you're the only one who's responded favorably to my suggestion for Saturday.<br>

But I now have it on a strong authority (a park ranger) that Chino Hills State Park will most likely be closed this weekend. Therefore, I think we need to postpone the gathering for the following Saturday, the 20th.<br>

I know some of you may not be able to make it on the 20th instead, and I'm truly sorry. But I don't want to have 40+ folks showing up to a locked gate this weekend.<br>

I didn't delete as each individual poster can delete their own message, but it really isn't a good idea to post any personal info on a chatlist. Cell phone numbers fall into the personal info category.<br>
<br>
Yahoo chatlist messages can be googled so they are open to the internet.<br>

You would be surprised how much more info can be obtained by breaking a cell phone number.<br>

How was your drive north?  (So... did you make dinner after all, or get them to take you out to dinner... or make sure you arrived late enough that they'd already eaten by then?)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">hey there - I drove home to Pearblossom and then got on the road to Taft right around 4:40.  <br>
At 6:10pm, I was filling up at the 76 Station in Gorman and it was 38 degrees . .. brrrrrrrrrrrr . . . . on the long stretch of darkness into Taft I honestly begin to have doubts about my sanity - and after meeting my husband in the parking lot of a K-mart - in the middle of nowhere - I was really wondering what I was doing when he took off into the darkness and we drove another twenty minutes due West . . .. .then down a rutted out dirt road and into a canyon - where our trailer was the only sign of life - well if you don't count the 3.5 billion frogs/toads that serenaded us through the night.  Dinner was done, and they had eaten,but I was really too tired to care at that point.<br>
On the bright side, I woke up to wild flowers all around us, and blue skies. <br>
We had a great time with my husbands cousin, and his son, and we got home safely :-)  So good trip all around - <br>
 <br>
NOW for the LB Lesson of the day -<br>
Did anybody know that our little "Newt" friend (kudos to RAV for correctly identifying the little guy) is TOXIC !!!!!!<br>
They suggest not handling them with bare hands, and if you do, to wash them right away.<br>
It is known as the California Newt or Taricha torosa.<br>
Hopefully no one got sick??  <br>
So, two lessons:<br>
1. Leaves of three - let it be (poison oak)<br>
2. cute orange salamanders are actually newts and they are TOXIC!!!!!  <br>

You know, Dezertratty, I had that mentioned in my post as I was writing it, but since we had TWO surprises, I deleted the newt mention, so Lee would recognize HIS surprise. (Couldn't figure out at the time how to mention both, cryptically. )<br>
<br>
How was your drive north? (So... did you make dinner after all, or get them to take you out to dinner... or make sure you arrived late enough that they'd already eaten by then?)<br>
