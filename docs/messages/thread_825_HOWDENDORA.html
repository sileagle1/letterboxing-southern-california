Whew!  Thanks be to GOD for protecting us from our little friend.  I guess our little guy [California Newt or Taricha torosa] was set free before he was stressed enough to interpret our visit as an "attack".  If we had come at him, say, with the sharp beak of a bird, his response would have been decidedly less calm.  I guess he saves his toxins for the serious stuff -- after all, we didn't hurt him at all, just delayed him in wherever he was going... probably looking for a mate, based on the article I read.  <br/>
<br/>
http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Taricha_torosa.html<br/>
<br/>
I used to keep these guys as pets, when I was a kid and found an occasional one in my backyard.  Never had any problems with them.<br/>
<br/>
I DID touch the poison oak with my fingertip, but took out a "wipe" right away and cleansed my finger... and since no rash has developed yet, I think I must be in the clear.  Laundered all our clothes, too, since our jeans had come into contact with the poison oak, too.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm... I wonder now if I should do something for my hiking boots.  Any suggestions???<br/>
<br/>
And yes, Zuhl is Cool, I did remember to "empty" my backpack.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Additionally... Kelsung kept his promise and set our event up on AQ (about midnight)... please sign up, all who haven't done so yet.  Since it's now past, perhaps you're having difficulty finding it?  Here's the link:  http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1642<br/>
<br/>
I was able to find it because I have a FAVORITE SEARCH set up for gatherings in my area... and that's what I click on, anytime I want to find it.<br/>

&gt; It is known as the California Newt or Taricha torosa.<br/>
&gt; Hopefully no one got sick?? <br/>
&gt; So, two lessons:<br/>

I can see the headline now - Strange "cult" found dead in forest with inky fingers  . . . . . <br/>
:-P<br/>
We used to pick up a lizard called  "Horned Toad" all the time.  It had a toxin it could shoot out of it's eye area - and just like you never having a problem with newt's, I never got shot :-)<br/>
So, all is well.  Thanks for the heads up on the "event" - I'll try and get my pics posted.<br/>

A fairly good rule of thumb is don't mess with brightly colored reptiles or bugs.<br/>

I was fully aware of the poisonous yellow frog in Costa Rica, but knew nothing of a strange yellow and black catapillar that I brushed from my<br/>
life jacket one morning on the Rio Pecuare. My hand stung for three days.<br/>

Sorry about your "caterpillar encounter", Don.  If it had been me, I would have picked it up and let it crawl all over my hands -- probably getting even more poison exposure than you got, brushing it off your life vest.  How cool, though, that you've been to Costa Rica!<br/>

My other pics can't be downloaded right now as they are bigger than the 3 megs AQ can handle, so I will have to fiddle with them later and see if I can get them downloaded.<br/>

What's all this talk of newts? Any chance it was this found near the 4th box of the Lost in the Wild series? I saw one there back in December but did not pick it up. I just uploaded a picture to atlas quest.<br/>

&gt; Hi there,<br/>
&gt; Â Â Â  I downloaded some photos on AQ.Â  If you go to the Events page and hit "Recent Events" you can post sign-up for Howdendora (I'm sure you all know this - but it took me a minute or two to figure out!!)<br/>
&gt; Anyway, you can see the "Newt" in question :-)<br/>
&gt; My other pics can't be downloaded right now as they are bigger than the 3 megs AQ can handle, so I will have to fiddle with them later and see if I can get them downloaded.<br/>

&gt; Paula's response: The thing is, it was a BROWN newt. Not even sure his "undercarriage" was brightly colored... we'll have to check our photos when they become available, because as I recall, his underside was pale, not bright.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry about your "caterpillar encounter", Don. If it had been me, I would have picked it up and let it crawl all over my hands -- probably getting even more poison exposure than you got, brushing it off your life vest. How cool, though, that you've been to Costa Rica!<br/>

&gt; &gt; If we had come at him, say, with the sharp beak of a bird, his response would have been decidedly less calm. I guess he saves his toxins for the serious stuff <br/>

&gt; &gt; I was fully aware of the poisonous yellow frog in Costa Rica, but knew nothing of a strange yellow and black caterpillar that I brushed from my life jacket one morning on the Rio Pecuare. My hand stung for three days.<br/>

I don't check the group more than once or twice a week, but decided to check it at 11:00 on Saturday so it was too late. Also had a little bit of a cold, so we didn't go. Oh well, at least I am better and ready for Chino Hills this Saturday.<br/>
