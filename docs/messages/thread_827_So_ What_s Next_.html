I went back to Chino Hills today, to get a few more. I will not be done with the "Hills" event, until I get them all, which will definately take a few more weekends.<br>
<br>
I also want to thank Kelsung for all his hard work carving, co-ordinating, and planting all those boxes. And having just found MrOspital's series, his work is also appreciated.<br>
