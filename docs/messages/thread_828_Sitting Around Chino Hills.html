I'm glad such a good group was able to come with it being postponed.  It was great to see everyone.<br>
<br>
Also, for being billed as a hiking event, I was surprised at how many boxes I actually got.  Twelve!  Thanks to Lee for planting a series of "waddle" friendly boxes and to my personal chauffeur for the morning, Kelsung, who hinted where a couple of other boxes might be located.  And of course, my favorite box of the day "Piper Pause."  How awesome to have my very own dedicated Lee & not so much Nancy box.  I have cut out the clues and pasted them in my log book next to my find.  That made my day :-)<br>

Oh, and for Dezert Ratty, here is the song I heard as my son was going to bed... "I love my rat, I love my rat, Don't take it away from me."  He slept with him Saturday night and then took him to the park with us on Sunday.<br>
<br>
After the baby comes, I'll have to plan a little meet and greet. :-)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's pretty funny :-)  I'm glad he liked "his" first finders prize :-)<br>
And kudos to Kelsung as well.  Even though I only did the one hike, I was proud of myself for making it - now I'll have an excuse to go back.  I might even check into their campground - it looked pretty neat.<br>
I hope Mr. Ospital made it home on time!  <br>
I have a big question for all of you computer geeks out there - my pictures are too big to download, is there anyway to "shrink" them ??  In layman's terms please! :-P<br>
I'll be meeting RAV at Griffith Park on Saturday - I'm sure all of you already have every LB there - but, if anyone wants to meet - let me know.<br>
