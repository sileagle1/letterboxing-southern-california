I just may join you.  I need to do some maintenance on the Johnny Depp boxes after a recent report.  I also have been planning to go after "The Idiot Box Series".  Q retired them in 2007, on the assumption they were lost in the wildfires, but it appears she never actually checked on them or pulled them.  In my ongoing quest to hunt down every possible box in So Cal, I think there's a chance a couple of them are still around, since they only have one "attempted" on AQ and none on LbNA, which arguably means that nobody has bothered looking since she retired them.<br>

Thanks for the prayers - the ankle is still pretty swollen - the good news is - when I broke it way way back when - my whole leg swelled and it turned black and blue and green and yellow and . . . <br>
this time it is just swollen and hurts like heck - so just tendons and ligaments involved :-{<br>
