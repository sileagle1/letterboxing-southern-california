Ventura County is definitely not Southern California (I think of it <br/>
as the Central Coast), but let's get back to Tiburcio Vasquez.  <br/>
Vasquez is Southern California's most famous bandito; obviously he <br/>
roamed far afield, but one of his most famous escapes was up the <br/>
Arroyo Seco while being chased by a Sheriff's posse, through present-<br/>
day Pasadena.  If you're going to plant a Vasquez series up in Kern <br/>
or Ventura County, I'm going to have to plant a sister series in Los <br/>
Angeles County, so this needs to be a trans-county series.<br/>

I think it is.  =)  It always strikes me as the start of the LA urban <br/>
sprawl while Santa Barabara is the approximate southern boundry of <br/>
the Central Coast.<br/>
<br/>
But it's all perspective, I suppose.  Those people on the east coast <br/>
probably call San Luis part of Southern California and San Francisco <br/>
is the "Central" Coast.  =)<br/>
