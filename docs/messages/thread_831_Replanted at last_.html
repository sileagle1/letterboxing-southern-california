Sorry for the delay... AND... the mystery about who my First Finder might have been, for Box #4, just might be solved:  Could it be ALARCH? (Whom I've spoken with, on the phone, but not yet met....)<br/>

I love mysteries solved... we're on the brink of a solution, anyway... if Alarch reads this and responds, that is.  <br/>

Did somebody say mystery? I love mysteries!  =-)<br/>
But I didn't know there was one about box #4.  *blushes* I had a lovely day exploring Covina's parks and was first to stamp in at the last 3.  I have your cute little cards pasted in my logbook to prove it. ; )  <br/>
(But don't tell anybody... )<br/>
Glad you have replaced these, it's a great series!   Hope to meet you soon!<br/>
