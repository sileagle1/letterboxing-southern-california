I had my computer crash around Christmas and have been "stealing" moments on different computers to answer e-mail, do a quick LB print out, etc . . . so have not done any real in depth playing around on the computer for awhile now.<br/>
However, I finally got my very own back - well a "new" one anyway-(woohoo) just prior to leaving for NC and after I got home, decided to check out the "Boards" on AQ.<br/>
I haven't been on them in quite awhile as I am not the brightest bulb anymore and sometimes feel like I am being punked for others entertainment - so, when I saw a poor soul from Torrance just being ripped apart, unmercifully, I came toher aide, privately, and suggested that she stay off the boards and don't let the bullies get toher, etc . . . I even let her know that Kelsung was a man, and not a girlas she had assumed :-}<br/>
Well,she just kept going and nowher "Posts" are the laughing stock of AQ and people are wondering if it is all ahoax??<br/>
After seeing where the Newb planted an LB - Calle Mayer "Home of the Bulldogs" - I got to wondering if it wasn't our own clever young LBer from that very same school??? Hmmmm????<br/>
If it's not you, we need to help this poor woman as she is making me look like an absolute genius!!! :-P<br/>

I've sent her a few private messages trying to be helpful.  After looking for her two boxes, I'm sure she's just a new person who needs to read a little more before posting questions.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did the same thing. I looked at one of her posts yesterday, and she is REALLY mad. Many people have been posting on the message boards that they have been writing as well. I have written several times too, but she hasn't responded. She only responded when I found one of her boxes. Dezert Ratty, just so you know she said she taught at Madrona MS for 9 years, then Calle for 3 years, then retired, that is why she planted a box there. She should stick to private e-mails, that way, she won't be the laughing stock of AQ. She definately needs to read more, before asking those questions that people either hate, or laugh at. But what I think is weird is that people have been telling her to read the tutorials, but she still sticks to writing the "posts" instead of reading anything. It kinda seems like the people who don't like her posts are making her not want to be a letterboxer anymore<br/>

P.S. I also told her Kelsung was a guy!<br/>
