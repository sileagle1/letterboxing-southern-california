That's so sad.  There have been times when the letterboxers get riled-up and the profuse postings on a subject get out of hand, and I just don't read the group digests for a few days until they declare the subject closed and move-on.  It's been irritating, but certainly nothing for me to QUIT over.  (Then again, I haven't been the target of anything -- or even felt like I might have been.)<br>

Ah, well... praying she'll find some grace in her heart for us.<br>

Funny thing is, the ones that were the worst seemed to be folks that had less than a 100 finds under their belts - go figure.  Rude and mean spirited sucks.<br>
