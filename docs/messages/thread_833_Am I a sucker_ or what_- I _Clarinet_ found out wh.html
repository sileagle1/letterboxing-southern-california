&gt; &gt; Hi there everybody,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had my computer crash around Christmas and have been "stealing" moments on different computers to answer e-mail, do a quick LB print out, etc . . . so have not done any real in depth playing around on the computer for awhile now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; However, I finally got my very own back - well a "new" one anyway- (woohoo) just prior to leaving for NC and after I got home, decided to check out the "Boards" on AQ.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I haven't been on them in quite awhile as I am not the brightest bulb anymore and sometimes feel like I am being punked for others entertainment - so, when I saw a poor soul from Torrance just being ripped apart, unmercifully, I came to her aide, privately, and suggested that she stay off the boards and don't let the bullies get to her, etc . . . I even let her know that Kelsung was a man, and not a girl as she had assumed :-}<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, she just kept going and now her "Posts" are the laughing stock of AQ and people are wondering if it is all a hoax??<br/>
&gt; &gt; After seeing where the Newb planted an LB - Calle Mayer "Home of the Bulldogs" - I got to wondering if it wasn't our own clever young LBer from that very same school???  Hmmmm????<br/>

That's so sad.  There have been times when the letterboxers get riled-up and the profuse postings on a subject get out of hand, and I just don't read the group digests for a few days until they declare the subject closed and move-on.  It's been irritating, but certainly nothing for me to QUIT over.  (Then again, I haven't been the target of anything -- or even felt like I might have been.)<br/>

Funny thing is, the ones that were the worst seemed to be folks that had less than a 100 finds under their belts - go figure.  Rude and mean spirited sucks.<br/>
