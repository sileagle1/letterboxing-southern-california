                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tonight, while my daughter's Girl Scout troop was planting plants as a service project for the park, I sauntered over to check on my bonus box that was in the park.  Alas!  <br/>
<br/>
Someone "discovered" the box indeed -- and its contents were strewn all over.  The good news:  I have my stamp! The bad news:  The logbook is gone.  I have the other, less important things:  the box itself, the baggies, the paper towel the stamp was wrapped in.<br/>
<br/>
Really, I'm thankful to have the opportunity to mostly just "put it back together" rather than just have it missing and having to start all over.  I can recreate the logbook, and even give credit to those who logged their finds at AQ and LBNA.  And... here's my opportunity to switch to a better quality box.  I'd figured a bonus box wouldn't get much activity, so wouldn't need a higher quality box, but might as well have it secure.<br/>
<br/>
Makes you kinda wonder what they did with the logbook, doesn't it?  I wonder if someone will end up contacting me about it, one of these days. <br/>
<br/>
Just sharing my experience, not really upset or anything.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">oh I hate that, but am glad your stamp is there!  Rome's Fist (now a "noxer") and I were looking for one in Hart Park, up on the ridge - by Scouting Bear - and as we were going along we found trash scattered and realized it was the box, log book, stamp, baggies . . . . . !  Some people, I tell you!!<br/>
 <br/>
Are you all reading the escapades of Green Tortuga?<br/>
I know Lee planted some boxes for him :-)  <br/>
Maybe I'll get there first . . . . <br/>
are you listening Kelsung - hee hee :-)<br/>
I saw Calle Mayer at the Regional Band Festival and think I was making eye contact with Clarinet 226 - if it wasn't him/you, some poor kid thinks an old lady was making "eyes" at him :-D<br/>
Oh well - by the way, how did you guys end up scoring?<br/>
Our band has been playing at "Superior" level all year and dropped the ball so bad at the competition that they got a "Good" - kinda like going from an A+ to a C- . . . . not "good" needless to say.<br/>
Oh well, the Grandparents from Summerlin, NV didn't know any better and thought they were marvelous :-)<br/>
Yeah Grandparents!!<br/>
Take care all - Dezert Ratty<br/>

yes you are - I know I will never figure out the vague clues for a couple of yours :-(<br/>
I asked Green Tortuga if he wanted a hot meal when he hit the Aqua Dulce area and he said he was still 200 miles away, and that was on the 12th.  I was doing the math and I think he'll be out here on/or around the 22-23rd.  <br/>
I'm hoping for the 23rd as I will be in Long Beach for a couple days - cleaning my daughters dorm out and working a BSA Bike ride in the area.<br/>
I hate to offer and then renege :-(<br/>
ah well . . . . Dezert Ratty<br/>
