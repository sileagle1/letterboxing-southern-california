Hope everyone is doing well. My daughter got her cast off two weeks ago but is now in a leg splint. She will have that for another 2 weeks. She still has some what visible fracture but is healing well. Also there is new bone growth where the growth bone had been broke away. She has tendon pain but is doing her exercises.
