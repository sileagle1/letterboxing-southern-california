I was excited thinking the Rally Monkey stamp would be in there but it was not. Am I missing something? <br/>
<br/>
I know there is a clue for Rally Monkey but I wasn't sure if the two had been combined?????<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to thank you all for your plants. While I wished I could have, I didn't get to all of them. It seems to be quite a challenge to plant in CA as you do not have very many overgrown trees and such as we do where I live in parks and cemeteries. <br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed finding:<br/>
<br/>
Walt (My most prized stamp being a HUGE Disney fan)<br/>
OCTO<br/>
Lair of the Beast<br/>
Heritage House<br/>
Crystal Catherdral<br/>
Find Nemo<br/>
Apollo 1 (We found 3 of 4 boxes)<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to make my first plant near Yorba cemetery, but could not find the perfect spot. I vow to be back though and 2 of the 4 people I converted to letterboxing have plans to plant at UCI and UCLA.<br/>
<br/>
I am so sorry that I was unable to meet with you all (Kelsung had asked if he could arrange something) but we were so busy all weekend. I hope to come back for more fun and hopefully we can meet and box together.<br/>

Wasn't there a clue as well?  As I recall, there was a clue leading to a nearby location with a stamp but no logbook.  Of course, we shouldn't be openly discussing a bonus box, should we....<br/>

Glad you had a fun visit.  We'll get together another time when you have a less hectic schedule.<br/>
<br/>
On that same subject, Doctor and Romana are coming to visit in a couple weeks.  They listed a meet-and-greet on AQ for anyone interested.  Dinner June 1st near Disneyland.  I'm kind of getting addicted to these little get-togethers with folks from out of town.<br/>
