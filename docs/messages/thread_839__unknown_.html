DOY!!!! Sorry for discussing it. I guess I assumed everyone had it. Nothing to see here, keep moving.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure when I will be there next as it is difficult to travel with 3 small kids. Hopefully it won't be too long. One of our NC letterboxers is moving to Edwards AFB, so take good care of her you hear? <br>
