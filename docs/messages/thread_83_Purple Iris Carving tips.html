If you haven't checked out Carving 101 on Ryan's web site it has  good tips on carving. I frankly wouldn't worry about your carving ability,every one that starts letterboxing has the same problem, 10 thumbs. Make sure you get some good tools, speed ball cutters( I use #1,#3,#5 blades) , some good material ( I use PZ Kut) and most important for my 60+ old eyes a magnifier on a stand (mine is made by Exacto) and keep practicing. If you stay with the same material you will find it easier to work with because of the consistency. I tend to carve a larger stamp than most folks carve and it is easier to get detail. Most new carvers when they start out use what I call a "negative" image, that is the out line of the subject is carved out as well as the details of the image. When you progress in your abilities you will probably do more "positive" images, that is when you carve out backgrounds and areas around the details. I do have a rule of thumb when it comes to stamp quality at least it seems to work out with our letterboxes. The best places have the crappiest stamps. The first letterbox we planted(12/27/2000 and #15 in California at the time) was in Tulare Co. and the stamp was an attempt to replicate a water fall,( I still have difficulty with water fall carving ), and that stamp is certainly no winner. When Silent Doug visited us in Kernville last summer he didn't mention that stamp much but he did appreciate the location, which he said was definitely at the top of his list for letterbox sites. While everyone does like cool stamps, for us it is the site or experience of the hunt that is the best part of letterboxing. Carve what you can and find a neat site and don't worry about what some one thinks about the stamp, they will be happy you gave them a neat hunt and site.<br/>
