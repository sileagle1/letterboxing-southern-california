                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well the good ol' high desert has been buzzing with athlete celebs - the latest victims of the Station Fire.<br/>
<br/>
Friday the "Tour of California" left from Palmdale, went down Historic Route 6 and up into the Mountains.<br/>
Seems, due to the Station Fire, and the subsequent damage to Hwy. 2, they could not leave from the beautiful downtown area of Pasadena and had to come up here, to my home turf area, and leave from Palmdale (to which I even say ewww) - thank goodness for the abundant rainfall that "greened" the area up!<br/>
<br/>
Coming down out of the Mountains, due to damage by the Station Fire, are athletes of a different variety - the PCT Hikers.  I passed several on Friday, in my race to CSULB (MOM, my RA let me know I have to be out by 5, you have to come now!!), and wondered if Green Tortuga was among them??<br/>
<br/>
I had to stay over in Long Beach due to a bike ride of a different sort today  - the Boy Scouts had a 25/50/100 miler - and I got "stationed" at Legg Lake handing out refreshments - which, by the way, is a pretty nifty park and very "Box Worthy" (hint hint) AND, when I got home, I saw an article in the paper that made me chuckle - evidently the residents of the Juniper Hills area have been a little nervous about all these people with scruffy appearances and backpacks coming down out of the mountains . . . they have been assured by the Juniper Hills Town Council President that "the hikers are generally quite conservation-minded folks, and are simply passing through" - (this from the man that stopped his recumbent bike in front of a Scout today causing him to endo over his handelbars and do a major face plant just prior to getting to Legg Lake today!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I emailed Ryan and asked if he was one of those folks and he says he just got to Wrightwood, so it wasn't him.<br/>
So maybe I'll see an LB Celeb walking down the road if I keep my eyes out, who knows!  I wonder if he'd do an exchange :-&gt;<br/>
<br/>

PS: the kid that did the face plant was all smiles and dripping blood when he pulled in - it's just one more great story to him :-P<br/>

Ask Zuhl sometime about the time as a young lady she took the chain off her bike and then lost it going down a hill, sliding on her face in the gravel.  Yikes!<br/>

Ryan is taking a "zero" day today.  <br/>
He was planning on pushing out of Wrightwood, but decided to stay when it begin to snow this morning.  Lee might have caught up with him there?  Who knows :-)<br/>
Where are the boxes you are looking for on the 2?  I might be able to talk you around to an alternate route??<br/>

I was able to get a couple new boxes planted though.  In some ways the exact location of a letterbox is like an exact moment in time.  Hopefully it will take Kelsung quite a few moments to figure out the clues to my new Lamppost letterbox. <br/>

I've already cursed you out privately, but now you taunt me again publicly.  I'll have you know I've lost a lot of sleep the last couple nights, and not just because of "Lost" finale overload.<br/>
<br/>
I've ruled out several ideas already, including GPS coordinates, unless it happens to be floating 100 miles off the coast of El Salvador.  But I'll crack this nut sooner or later.  And I thank you for the challenge.<br/>
<br/>
I just hope BumbleBeeBunny is busy enough with twins that they won't beat me to it.  And MrOspital is no slouch, either, so the game is afoot!  Wouldn't it be great if Kern Kern beat us all to the punch?<br/>
<br/>
But speaking of GPS coordinates, I came up with an inspired idea recently that will appear in a new clue soon.  However, I've been in a slump again, because I have several half-finished replants and a handful of new ones waiting in the closet for me to get around to completing.  But you know me:  I'll slow down for a little while, then bust a dozen at once.<br/>
<br/>
And while I'm rambling in this long post, the boxes along the 2 I was referring to are mostly on LbNA.  Two older ones by Hamish Macbeth and two by VIENNA that are all very near one another north of Altadena, and one by Katpau just west of the the 39, very near Devil's Punchbowl, albeit with mountains in between.<br/>
<br/>
So, do you happen to know what areas, if any, of the 2 are open?  The fire covered a huge area, so I have serious doubts, but I'm gonna look anyhow.<br/>

Anyway, Ryan "Green Tortuga" was going to get a hold of me when he came down off the mountain, due to a closure of the PCT that is forcing a detour just above where I live, if I hear from him, I might be able to get insight as to where the closures/openings of the 2 are??  If not, I can try and find out through the Forest Circus - I know it must be partially closed between La Canada and Wrightwood as that would have been the route the "Tour of California" would have taken. <br/>
Anyway, you guys have fun - I still have to get the one, close to Kelsung's Lair, that I DiD figure out but the eye's in the fjord freaked us out and we split :-P<br/>

No, I was not able to meet up with Ryan. The timing just wasn't right. The lag on his blog posts, made it difficult to track his where abouts. And my 2004 boxes on the PCT, were missed by him, because I added them too late to AQ. Some people don't bother with that other LB site (all 4 are literally just a couple steps off of the PCT). <br/>

&gt; Poor Zuhl!Â  Well, she looks pretty darn good for a kid that did a downhill face plant!Â  <br/>
&gt; I got a kick stand stuck in the top of my right ankle, during one heck of a downhill wreck as a kid,Â and still have the scar to prove it! Yucko!!<br/>
&gt; Ryan is taking a "zero" day today.Â  <br/>
&gt; He was planning on pushing out of Wrightwood, but decided to stay when it begin to snow this morning.Â  Lee might have caught up with him there?Â  Who knows :-)<br/>
&gt; Where are the boxes you are looking for on the 2?Â  I might be able to talk you around to an alternate route??<br/>

&gt; &gt; Seems, due to the Station Fire, and the subsequent damage to Hwy. 2, they could not leave from the beautiful downtown area of Pasadena<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been hoping they will reopen hwy 2 for a year now, because there are 5 boxes along it and I want to confirm or deny their deaths.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So maybe I'll see an LB Celeb walking down the road if I keep my eyes out, who knows! I wonder if he'd do an exchange :-&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's hoping you and/or Lee manage to meet up with him. Have fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; PS: the kid that did the face plant was all smiles and dripping blood when he pulled in - it's just one more great story to him :-P<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ask Zuhl sometime about the time as a young lady she took the chain off her bike and then lost it going down a hill, sliding on her face in the gravel. Yikes!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The 2 is closed between La Canada  and Red Box. The news today reports that  the various "Tujunga Canyon"  roads are closed.  There seems to be conflicting info coming from different sources 'cause the Mt Wilson Observatory website refers you to an alternate route using Tujunga Cyn.  If there is some back way open to the observatory, you'd be going very near Vienna's Strawberry Peak box.  <br/>
<br/>
Switzer Falls is definitely closed. I found Hamish McB's box  5 years ago (a store-bought stamp, but a rather nice one).  FYI, in case they ever re-open, my notes mention my dog falling into the water crossing the stream, and if you arrive after the parking lot fills up, it's a long uphill walk back to your car in the secondary parking. <br/>
I'm really hoping some of these boxes were able to survive, so keep us posted, and good luck!<br/>

&gt; So, do you happen to know what areas, if any, of the 2 are open?  The fire covered a huge area, so I have serious doubts, but I'm gonna look anyhow.<br/>

Picked my son up at school today and stopped at a Yard Sale about a mile from the school.  Found a clarinet and a Yamaha oboe, both in unblemished hard cases, for sale - jumped in the car and caught the Music Teacher on his way out of the parking lot - needless to say, the school now has two oboe's . .. woohoo! Oh, and an extra clarinet :-)<br/>
