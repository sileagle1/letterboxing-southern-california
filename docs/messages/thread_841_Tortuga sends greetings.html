                    <div class="plaintext-content">Gave Tortuga, Charmin and Running Wolf (two of Ryan'sPCT pals)a big carb loaded spaghetti dinner tonight. <br>
He apologizes for missing Lee's boxes, and was upset that he had done so! <br>
Evidently he printed off his clues, on AQ :-P, a couple weeks prior to his start date, and hasn't checked since. <br>
Due to the PCT closure and detour, he walked right past one of mine and RAV's too, and he had the clues to RAV's!!<br>
Anyway, I handed the three of themoff to a friend of mine, that lives pretty close to where I picked them up this evening, and after a shower -MUCH NEEDED- and hopefully a good night's sleep, they will be off on their adventures bright and early.<br>
They should beat Vasquez Rocks by Friday I would imagine. I think they said they are going about 12 miles a day??<br>
I totally forgot to ask him about the 2 and if he knew what portions are closed? Sorry Kelsung:-(<br>

P.S. (I have memories of spending a couple of Thanksgivings, as a kid, at Vazquez Rocks, with a couple of other families.  Now that I'm the one who cooks for Thanksgiving, I realize what a lot of work and preparation it must've taken, for the moms to prepare and then pack up our Thanksgiving meals, so that we could all picnic there at Vazquez Rocks.  I did check last week, to see if there were any letterboxes there, but alas... there weren't.  Then again, who wants to reach into a crevice where there might be a rattlesnake?  And... what's to prevent kids who are just playing from reaching in and finding letterboxes?  Then again, all I remember are the rocks... and me out there, making believe I was "Charlie the Lonesome Couger," of Disney movie fame.)<br>

Actually RAV doesn't know GT was here . . . . it was so last minute.  I'll be in trouble I'm sure . . . I have a retired Atty. friend, who moved out here for some peace and quite, that was happy for company (too quite out here for her) . . . . plus her place is about an 1/8 mile off the detour, so it worked great!<br>

I didn't actually find it but had a lovely hike searching for it, found a geocache, and got some beautiful<br>
 pictures. = ) <br>

i'd be in for a planting picnic!<br>
