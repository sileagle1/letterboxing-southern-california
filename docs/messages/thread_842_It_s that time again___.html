Hey, how about Joe Jost's? It's not that big, but a real cool place to hang out. And that will give me an excuse to get out some more Long Beach boxes I've been contemplating. Ever heard of The Skinny House?<br>

I'm putting you in charge of my Socal Social Cal(endar) for the day, Kelsung.  Are you available during the day for boxing as well, or just the evening?  In any case, I am seriously looking forward to this trip!!!<br>

Is this going to be listed as some kind of event? I'd like to meet for an exchange and/ or hike and/or beverage. I'm a little further south than LA but would be willing to make the trip to make all your acquaintances.<br>

Hey, how about Joe Jost's? It's not that big, but a real cool place to hang out. And that will give me an excuse to get out some more Long Beach boxes I've been contemplating. Ever heard of The Skinny House?<br>

Well, I can say that my "glorious return" to letterboxing has been a little less than glorious.  Last weekend I went looking for five boxes in the northern Santa Barbara County area.  I found one.  :P  Maybe I'll have better luck locally.<br>

I will figure out something for a little boxing earlier in the day.  My free time is severly limited right now though, so it might take me a bit to figure something out, so just be patient :-)<br>

I need your address and Pooper's date of birth and full name so I can send her quilt to you.  I can get the info on Fri or you can send it to me.  Thanks, Gwen<br>
