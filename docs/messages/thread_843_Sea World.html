Does anybody know why there seem to be no boxes planted in Sea World?  I realize some are hidden or WOM, so perhaps I'm not looking hard enough.  If anybody has experience planting there, I'd be interested in hearing about it.  I have free access to the park this entire summer and am thinking about trying a few mini boxes there to see how long they last.   <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxes are generally frowned upon on private property without permission of the owners.  I think amusement parks would certainly fall into that category.  However, I seem to be in a minority on this opinion.<br>
<br>
There have been many boxes that have come and gone at Disneyland over the years, and there is currently a lot of them there, mostly by Vienna, though I don't know how many are still viable.  They have many finds, so boxers certainly show an interest in them.<br>
<br>
Other parks, however, don't seem to hold the same fascination as Disney.  There are only a couple at Universal Studios, one that I think is missing at Knott's, and none I know of at Wild Rivers or Magic Mountain.<br>

They are very diligent with the landscaping AND it is such high traffic place that it would be hard to be stealth about retrieving it without drawing attention to it.<br>

I don't think there are any boxes in Sea World. I was thinking about a couple, but it might be awhile before I do. You planting some sounds great. Maybe it will get me to plant mine.<br>
