                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sometimes when you write these puzzlers, and know the answer; it seem so obvious.  I deliberately did not add much of a hint, to keep it challenging, but plan to add a new hint to the clue every month it goes unfound.  So you might want to revisit the clue each 22nd of the month (probably not at that same time each month - is this a hint? Of course not - it not time yet.)  Nancy says nobody will ever get it, but I know better, by the impossible clues on some of Kelsung plants; and how quickly my "POG" and "Citrus" boxes were found.<br/>
<br/>
We are honored and suprised Kelsung found 77 of our boxes.  That's well over half of our 145 plants, 26 are outside of California, 3 in Northern Cal, and many were retired fairly early, not to mention the 5 that have never been found.  "SE Lamppost LP" being one of them, and no reported finds on the Nimrod series in Kernville, CA.<br/>

Happy Hunting,<br/>

<br/>
I feel that way about a couple of mine that I don't think are TOO hard, but seem to stump many folks.  Others I intended to not necessarily be for everyone, such as "Bridge" which is the best idea I've come up with.<br/>
<br/>
But I wasn't fishing for hints.  I honestly love the brevity of that clue, and once I've found it (and I WILL find it) I'm sure I'll praise its cleverness to other boxers, as I have with POG, Citrus and Geometric Oddity (which, I recall, I convinced you to make even a few words shorter after I found it).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We are honored and surprised Kelsung found 77 of our boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I was a little surprised when I added it up, too.  That includes 30 older boxes not listed on AQ, such as "Out Of The Park" which is another fun brief clue.  I have my own brief clue worked out in my head, but I've thus far been unable to find a suitable location to pull it off.<br/>

It's what I feel every time I point someone at my "The Heavens" clue.  Even BumbleBeeBunny took two trips on that one.<br/>

Speaking of BBB, the grandparents posted a thread on AQ about the birth of the twins last week, but it just hit me that it has yet to be mentioned on here.<br/>

Don't take it personally.  Work of late hasn't allowed me to make a trip in<br/>

ever answer emails when you are sick, taking meds that make you fuzzy, and<br/>
are so sleepy you can't keep your eyes open. <br/>

kelsung, i don't take it personally at all. life does tend to get in the way<br/>

<br/>
i really hope you do make the trip. if for no other reason than i would like<br/>
to know if the clues work. that and i am rather proud of that stamp. <br/>
