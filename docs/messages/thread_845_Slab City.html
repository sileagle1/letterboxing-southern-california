a "mae west" was the slang for the old type life jackets - because back when they first came out, Mae West was the "it" girl of the day.<br>
The vests are really bulky, especially around the "chest" area.<br>
I was soooooo skinny as a kid that with a life vest on, it was a struggle to stay up right!  <br>
I'm glad someone got smart and made them a little more stream lined :-P<br>
I really hope Ryan doesn't put the picture in he took before we all parted for the night :-(<br>
Gotta go - Bible Study class here this morning and downstairs a mess!<br>

Soooooo, it looks like you need to plant an LB in honor of the Mammoth erection if nothing else :-P<br>

Salton Sea - what could you possibly be doing out there?<br>
I remember my Uncle dropping me over the edge of his boat and me, in my little orange Mae West, dog paddling like mad to get away from all the dead fish (red tide), but the fish, caught in the eddy of my dog paddling wake, just kept following me with their big open mouths and dead staring eyes . . . . around and around the boat . . . what a nightmare! granted this was many moons ago and I was but a wee ratty at the time . . . . but still!<br>
hmmmmmmmmmm, I wonder if that's why I don't care for fish too much? <br>
:-P<br>

Ratty, I do want to plant a series of letterboxes documenting the exploits of the Gypsy Camp Collective. First I need to learn how to carve -- or find someone else who wants to share the project with me.<br>
<br>
For info about our band of merry pranksters:<br>
<br>
http://www.thegypsycamp.com/<br>
<br>
This site needs updating. For one thing, we have a new location for "official" Gypsy Camps, out in Oak Park beneath a huge oak tree that looks like a squid.<br>
<br>
