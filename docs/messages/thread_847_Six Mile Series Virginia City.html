                    <div class="plaintext-content">We attempted 4 out of 5 of these boxes.  All 4 were not there due too erosion, sewage run off from a newer plant up the hill, over grown wild roses, trees down.  Nine of us scowered the areas and found nothing.  We were also stopped by law enforcement and told that the road is not a safe one to be hiking on and they had many calls to the station from drivers that were concerned.  Of course we were all on the edge of the road or walking in the dirt.  He stated there are tons of drunk driver and speeder accidents on this road.  There were no accidents while we were there but there were a ton of speeders and so many blind curves they can't see around.  We had to listen for the cars coming to warn the kids.  The boxes haven't been recorded since 07 so this is probably why.  There probably wasn't as much activity on this road in 07 as there was this last weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
I have sent an email to the owner of the boxes in hopes that she will either take the listing down or atleast warn  people of the dangerous road.<br/>
<br/>
We also hit Bucket of Blood which was a great one.  Met the planter and enjoyed the setting.  Even won some money.  Not much but it was a win.  <br/>
<br/>
We had been to Virginia City last year but did not have our boxing supplies with us.  The history of this town will take more than a couple visits.  We all enjoyed it very much.  <br/>
<br/>
Don and Gwen we had hoped to get your box in Bishop but were just too tired.  And I do all of the driving.  We will definitely go for it next time.  <br/>
<br/>
We also report there is a box missing in Carson City, 5 Mail Order Brides.  We found Leave it to Beaver and while sitting in the vehicles itching from mosqitos lol we read the next clues and it brought us right back to where we were sitting lol.  So we got out and made the hike again.  There are quite a few people on this trail and across the river.  However I did have mosqito repellant that we all used for the second hike lol. After not finding the 5 Mail Order Brides we headed off to Voyage through the Solar System.  <br/>
<br/>
Upon arriving to the entry of Voyage through the Solar System I realized I had left my book back at the spot of the mail order brides.  I actually started to cry!  Kim and I jumped back in my truck while the others hiked out for the voyage one, drove back and low and behold my book was still there!  I thank God out loud!  It was open and looked as though someone had thumbed through it but everything was there.  (loose stampings from our very first boxes).<br/>
<br/>
We headed back to mail order brides and waited in the air conditioning for everyone to come back.  After we headed home and had spaghetti with the sauce we had simmered in the crock pot all day.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great vacation, and a great deal of hiking in Lake Tahoe too.  We had spent the whole day in Tahoe but most of that was hiking to see the light house (which was not what we expected lol) But the hike was great and there was also a bear siting.  My calfs are still aching from that hike and so were everyone else lol.  Stupid me didn't think it was going to be a hike, thought it was something we would drive up too because we were told by the family this light house was here.  lol  So I didn't look it up myself.  I wore sandels!  lol  It was fine actually just had some dirty feet in the end and tripped about 5 times.  hahahaha Oh and hiking up from the lighthouse my daughter says good luck mom and of course I look up at her and not the steps and tripped and had to grab on to the steps infront of me to catch myself from doing lots of damage lol.  <br/>
<br/>
So much fun just had to share.  All in all it was a wonderful time even with those boxes that were missing.  Well worth it and tons of exercise and learning thank you to all!<br/>
