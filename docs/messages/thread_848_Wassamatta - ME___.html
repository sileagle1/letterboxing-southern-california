I suggested we throw some things in my van and just make a road trip out of it, but hubby wasn't too interested in that . . . Soooooo, I may drop in and say "hey" at Joe Jost's on Friday instead, I mean, I need a T-shirt from some place this summer!!!!  <br>
I have a new Sig stamp I am using until the end of the year, and I just know you all want it! :-P<br>
What time are you meeting?<br>
