I mapped out a number of boxes, see the full list below, you may want to read/print the clues.  (I just purchased clue tracker for my iPod touch!)<br>
<br>
Let's meet at Heartwell Park at 1pm.  This is the location of California State Bird.  There is no way we will be able to do all the boxes, but we can map out a plan together.  If you can't be there at 1, send me an email <hgraziano@sbcglobal.net> and I will send you my cell number.  You can call me when you are close and I'll tell you where we are.<br>
