I mapped out a number of boxes, see the full list below, you may want to read/print the clues.  (I just purchased clue tracker for my iPod touch!)<br/>
<br/>
Let's meet at Heartwell Park at 1pm.  This is the location of California State Bird.  There is no way we will be able to do all the boxes, but we can map out a plan together.  If you can't be there at 1, send me an email <hgraziano@sbcglobal.net> and I will send you my cell number.  You can call me when you are close and I'll tell you where we are.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Cerdo Latino<br/>

<br/>
2: Head up Studebaker to Carson, then west to Heartwell:<br/>

&gt; &gt; The Bunny Box - maybe carve a bunny stamp if you can<br/>
<br/>
3: Head west on Carson all the way till it ends at San Antonio:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Film Locations - this is the one to skip if short on time<br/>
<br/>
4: Long Beach Blvd to 405 south, exit Cherry south to Skyline Drive:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Signal Hill Letterbox<br/>
&gt; &gt; Great Views<br/>
&gt; &gt; Signal Hill Races<br/>
<br/>
5: Willow east to 405 south, exit Seal Beach Blvd south:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Construction Mediation - a little bit of a walk<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maui Memories<br/>
&gt; &gt; Saint Paddy's Day Pub Crawl - new stamp, new clues, new location<br/>
<br/>
6: Cross the border from Seal Beach to Long Beach:<br/>
&gt; &gt; CJ's Funbus<br/>
&gt; &gt; Marina Pacifica Plumbing Problem - this one is a must!<br/>
<br/>
7: Head up PCH to 7th:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lost My New Green Belt<br/>
&gt; &gt; CA's 1st<br/>
&gt; &gt; ??<br/>
