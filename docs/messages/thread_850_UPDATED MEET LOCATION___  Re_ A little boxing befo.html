My son has football practice as well - so, if we do get to go LBing, it would have to be on a weekend, after my little charge gets old enough to eat on it's own.<br>
There are so many LB's down your way, I'm jealous, have fun on your "vacation"!!<br>

I would love to O'Roar (I just made you Irish :-P) but, I won't be able to - I have a little abandoned critter we are trying to hand feed and it needs to be eye dropper fed every two hours right now - and, I can't get the kids to commit to feeding it - which is the reason I didn't get to go LBing with the group today :-( - soooo, I'm out of luck.  <br>
My son has football practice as well - so, if we do get to go LBing, it would have to be on a weekend, after my little charge gets old enough to eat on it's own.<br>
There are so many LB's down your way, I'm jealous, have fun on your "vacation"!!<br>

Oh man don't worry about the rock - when I found it, it was just laying off in the bushes, so I wrote MO and let her know it was w/o (I couldn't find one that wasn't cemented down!) Well, before I could get back to place a new one, someone else had come to the rescue - but, it was so funny, I had to take a picture and captioned it "LCR" - I won't tell you what that means, so it won't give it away :-)<br>
As to Kelsung's ???? after CA 1st - I imagine it has to do with what the real estate world say is the most important thing when looking for property (and they usually say it three times for emphasis)<br>
Wish I could join you guys - have fun - may see you at Jost's but looking doubtful :-(<br>

Ooh, forgot to mention Cerdo Latino needs some help. It says it need a rock, so you know if you got one of those handy....<br>
