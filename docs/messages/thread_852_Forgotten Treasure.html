                    <div class="plaintext-content">Alright, who's up for a real hunt with me?<br/>
<br/>
As some of you know, I've made it my mission to confirm or deny the deaths of many of the older boxes in the So Cal area.  Among others, I have successfully found two of Buzzard's Repetto Ranch Raid series, and two of Q's Idiot Box series.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have a new goal, and wonder if any would like to join me.  Way back in Jan 2007 I went after The Data Recovery Mission.  I found box 1, but not 2 and 3.  At the time, 4 and 5 were listed as missing, so I didn't bother going any further.  I was still young and weak.<br/>
<br/>
Q has since retired the listing, and the note in the clues says Unknown as of 5/11/07, however Granite Pioneer logged finds on boxes 4, 5 and 7 in Nov 2007.  I think at least those three, if not others, may still be viable.  They are at least worth a look.<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe we can plan a day to get together at Bronson Canyon.  Who's in?<br/>
<br/>
My ulterior motive is that Buffalo Tony, Maule and I planted a box up this same trail in 2009 that has since gone missing.  Since I want to get a replacement out there, this is an excuse to motivate me.<br/>

PS  My real Holy Grail currently is Buzzard's Marvin box, the clue to which was in Commander K-9, which is missing.  My only leads are Lee (who says he once possessed the clue, but never hunted the box) and Alarch (who may have found the box).  I think the three of us need to pool our resources (i.e. your fuzzy memories and my undaunted determination) and hunt this one down.<br/>

I can't help but think, these were really simple carves and a cool series. Anyone interested in re-planting the missing  parts? Since you're making the entire hike anyway... Which ones do you have, Kelsung?  In stamps, not box #s.  = )  I might have time to carve a couple of the ones I have before then. <br/>

&gt; &gt; at Bronson Canyon in that last parking lot. We don't want to be out <br/>

<br/>
The Marvin clue?  AWESOME!  The hunt is on!!<br/>
<br/>
As for Data, I only got the first stamp, which was the torso (the largest one).  Since the clue says that #5 is a separate Starfleet logo, my guess is that #2 was the head, 3 &amp; 4 were arms and 6 &amp; 7 were legs.  Meaning that the ones I'm guessing are still there are the logo, an arm and a leg.<br/>
<br/>
I'm certain #2 is gone, because I've rechecked the location both when planting my Don't Think box, and when checking on it to discover it missing.  I also rechecked #1, but upon rereading the clue, I was looking in the wrong place, so it may be there.<br/>

I would love to go on one of your "hunts" in the fall :-}<br/>
But I have a question for you LB fans out there . . . . I have a camp space for the 3 day camping Event being put on by Camp fire lady in Battleground, WA the last weekend of august. I was going to drive up, but all of my cohort's in crime have backed out on me due to conflicting schedules or health related issues - now, my health is a bit dodgy at best and all though the spirit is willing, I'm afraid the "flesh" can't quite make that drive on it's own anymore - so would anyone be interested in a road trip? I'm just putting it out there to see if anyone would be interested - since CFL is looking for spots to stick people who want to come but weren't fortunate enough to nab a camp site. <br/>
Heck, I may just see about flying up, but there was something about getting away for awhile that was really appealing :-P<br/>

Somehow, I don't think we're going to make it. <br/>
According to the News, It is going to be so HOT this weekend, that it will break records. This morning, it was 93 degrees, at 10:00 AM. I don't think I want to be hiking in that kind of weather.<br/>
<br/>
Could I suggest maybe moving it to a different weekend, when its not so hot?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are you going to set it up as a small event listing on AQ? Event stamp? <br/>

&gt; &gt; Alright, who's up for a real hunt with me?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As some of you know, I've made it my mission to confirm or deny the deaths of many of the older boxes in the So Cal area. Among others, I have successfully found two of Buzzard's Repetto Ranch Raid series, and two of Q's Idiot Box series.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, I have a new goal, and wonder if any would like to join me. Way back in Jan 2007 I went after The Data Recovery Mission. I found box 1, but not 2 and 3. At the time, 4 and 5 were listed as missing, so I didn't bother going any further. I was still young and weak.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Q has since retired the listing, and the note in the clues says Unknown as of 5/11/07, however Granite Pioneer logged finds on boxes 4, 5 and 7 in Nov 2007. I think at least those three, if not others, may still be viable. They are at least worth a look.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, maybe we can plan a day to get together at Bronson Canyon. Who's in?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My ulterior motive is that Buffalo Tony, Maule and I planted a box up this same trail in 2009 that has since gone missing. Since I want to get a replacement out there, this is an excuse to motivate me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Kelsung<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; PS My real Holy Grail currently is Buzzard's Marvin box, the clue to which was in Commander K-9, which is missing. My only leads are Lee (who says he once possessed the clue, but never hunted the box) and Alarch (who may have found the box). I think the three of us need to pool our resources (i.e. your fuzzy memories and my undaunted determination) and hunt this one down.<br/>

It is supposed to cool down a bit on Sunday. I was also going to suggest hiking to the top first  (where the final box is/was) and getting the rest of the boxes on the way down - it's all downhill from there. <br/>
There's also road access near the penultimate box,  I had to wait for picnickers to leave and several other finders made the same comment in the log, so it might be possible to do some kind of carpool to avoid a round trip hike. <br/>
Anyway, this is a better weekend for me, too.<br/>
<br/>
We could do Marvin in addition to/instead, but keep in mind these two are old and may well be missing.<br/>

Alright, then let's stick with tomorrow, 9am, Bronson Canyon.<br/>
<br/>
Kelsung<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anyway, this is a better weekend for me, too.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; I won't be available for a while after this weekend and was hoping for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the big cool-down on Sunday<br/>
<br/>

That was Bronson Canyon. It's a section of Griffith Park but accessible only from Hollywood. Q has a Batman box still there.<br/>
It was a quarry at one time before becoming the Batcave. That's only a small section of it; the other trails lead back up into the rest of Griffith Park.<br/>
