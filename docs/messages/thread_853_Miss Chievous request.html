The following is from Miss Chievous and was posted on AQ under LB Exchanges;<br>
I'm going to visit my home town for the first time in 15 years in September and I want to plant a few boxes while I'm there. The town I grew up in is at the base of an awesome canyon in the Los Angeles Crest National Forest and no plans at all, yet not that far from other places where people have planted in the L.A. county area. This canyon is very beautiful and versatile, and HUGE. Fishing, camping, hiking, great place to dump a body, are all wonderful options of this canyon. Ah, you were paying attention! I'd like to plant a series that would be a murder mystery of sorts. Every box would represent a fictional person who fell victim to a serial killer on the loose who needs to be stopped now! Through this hunt you will need to find clues and evidence that will lead you to solve the mystery and get this guy off the streets!<br>
<br>
I can provide the logbooks and containers. Also in the area is the house from E.T., the end of Route 66, a really old pop shop that carries all sorts of sodas and not one comes from independent small companies, my high school is pretty famous claiming it's the most filmed high school in the world, and a local landmark the cross of San Ysidro which is like our towns Hollywood sign.<br>
<br>
Any interest please AQmail me!<br>

Would love somebody to do this that lives closer to that area, and that loves to do MnG's (Kelsung kelsung kelsung kelsung . . . piper paws??? ) - she might be up to traveling farther south, or southeast for a MnG??<br>
I know she wants to do a series in the Big Tujunga Canyon, but that might have to be a separate thing???<br>
First weekend sounds good to me - I haven't got to meet the little Pooper Paws yet, so would like it if Piper Paws could come.<br>
Getting ready to leave for MT. in search of my "roots", checking LB's along the way (like I'm going to get to do any with hubby and son along) and found a carve by Tdyans up in Utah!  <br>
May have to get that one just cause :-)<br>

Her latest email said she'll be staying, of all places, at the Point Fermin Lighthouse!  Obviously, I had to mention my series. :)  Piper, if you would like to set something up in or near San Pedro, that would be great.<br>
<br>
I'm actually surprised she hasn't popped into this conversation yet.  She joined the board last week, but that was for the purpose of finding a certain Green Belt.<br>

Well I guess it's time I did "pop" out then!  I've just been reading through the board and checking out what's there, what's not, what people liked and such.  Figured I'd stay quiet and mind my business, just feel the waters I guess.  <br>
<br>
I am going out from the 10th to the 20th of Sept.  I only have reservations at the lighthouse from the 13th to the 16th (hopefully the 12th too) but besides that we haven't booked yet but will probably also be the San Pedro area.  And going to be hitting Disneyland, and Tujunga for a day, maybe two, but just day trips.  Otherwise we have no set plans and even what I mentioned is just penciled in really.  Disney will be during the week, probably closer to the end of the trip.  <br>
<br>
Anywho, I just wanted to introduce myself, but don't want to carry on too much.  <br>
