Anyway, I checked on this one for the first time in almost a year, (still there) and I just wanted to note that I did some maintenence. I swapped out the old store bought stamp for a new handcarved one. The most important change is that it is now a multiple stamp box. If you have a stamp that has to do with Gardens, you can add it to the box if you like. I'm making it, literally, a Botanical Letterbox. <br>
