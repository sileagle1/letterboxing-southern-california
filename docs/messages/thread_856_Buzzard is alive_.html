He says he really needs to get back into boxing, and even checked on several of his Halloween boxes recently, noting that "Bat and Moon" was still in place.  This is one I attempted way back in 2007 (one of the three not even listed on AQ), so it looks like I've got to try again.<br>

I told him to pop in here, as we'd all to here from him.  I also mentioned we're working on a meet and greet.  Here's hoping he becomes active again.<br>

I was lucky that when I started boxing there were many fine boxes within a reasonable distance to hunt for, and many of them were his.<br>
