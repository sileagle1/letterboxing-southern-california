I've carved Moo Carve. I got I 2x4 block of it, and it is kinda like a cross <br/>
between Speedy Carve and Speedy Cut. It does crumble like Speedy Cut, but not as <br/>
much, and its not so powdery, and its a lot better than speedy cut. In fact I <br/>
used it to carve the stamp for my FRANKLIN LAKE" box. I even made a HH called <br/>
