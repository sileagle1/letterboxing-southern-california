I haven't planted many, due to location, but have had two go missing due to Geocaching - sooooo, now I do over kill.  <br/>
I make a point of mentioning "This is NOT a Geocache" on my lid note, I write on the back of the stamp itself, "Not swag, do not remove", AND to finish it off, I put it on the back of the log book as well.  <br/>
This may sound excessive, but recently the BSA decided to make Geocaching a Merit Badge and most of the places I have planted, or wanted to, are now covered in Geocaches from all the local Troops - not to mention all the Geocaches that were already there! <br/>
By the way - I am not a Scout hater, been in for several years now.<br/>

We make sure to have a note attached to the lid of the box that states that it is a letterbox, not a geocache. It has happened to us a few times, but not as much since we attached the note.<br/>

If you hide your box in an area where geocachers are already looking, they are bound to find it. Also, marking the lid or the box, "This is NOT a geocache" is a great idea.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">All good suggestions, especially the idea of contacting the cacher who might have your stamp.  I registered with geocaching.com a couple years ago to keep track of what gets near my boxes.  GPS is good to within 40 feet, so I have moved a couple 50 feet away from a nearby cache.  When this wasn't feasible, labels help, but are often unnoticed or ignored.  After repeated attacks on a couple, I've been forced to simply retire them.  But currently, I have 4 boxes that coexist with a nearby cache with no problems at all.<br/>
<br/>
In summary: label 'em, move 'em or retire 'em!<br/>

Sometimes the owner makes typos or their coordinates are just plain off (by 100+ feet) and then you have to consider how determined geocachers are to find the prize.

Long story short... if your box is in the same general area as a geocache, the geocachers will probably wander around and find your box. (and your boxers may even wander around and find the geocache) <br/>
