We are going to Italy on the 15th, so if it is not the 13th, someone else will have to plan it.  Not that I am doing much ;-)  Whatever works for the most people.  Don't plan it around me.<br>

Last time I was in the Ports O' Call area, there was a large outdoor restaurant right on the water - not sure what it was called, but there was definitely lots of room there??  Kelsung, Gwen??<br>
Hope you had a fun trip up the coast Piper - <br>

I think for a day of boxing, you should start with my Boy Scouts box since they close their gates at like 4:30, then go on to Kelsung's suggestions. If you do Wanda and Pete's Little Whale Watch one, no spoilers, but BRING GLOVES! You'll have a great time boxing in San Pedro, and would recommend all of them.<br>
To bad Moonlight Rider is gone. That was a good one.<br>

Kelsung, you WOULDN'T!!! (Finishing Alphabet Soup may turn out to be my crowning achievement in life... many years from now, since I have only half the clues, at this point -- and THEN still have to figure out how to solve it.)  Have a wonderful time, everybody.  Sorry to have to miss out on seeing y'all.<br>
