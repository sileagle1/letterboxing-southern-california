Working around Football practice, Boy Scout functions and work schedules - woo hoo! :-P<br>
When were you up there?  <br>
We ended up going to a little tiny place in Montana and seeing the church my Great Grandparents helped build.  The folks there had a special service for us and a Potluck "Supper" after wards.  I didn't want to come home.<br>
We hit St. George on the way home and it was 112 - really wanted to head back then!<br>
When are we meeting in Wrightwood??<br>

Dezert Ratty... were we on essentially the same trip this summer, only<br>
heading in opposite directions?!  We went NV, UT, WY (a week of camping in<br>
Yellowstone), then ID, OR, and finally back to CA.  Only found 2<br>
letterboxes, and one M.I.A. in UT -- (aside from checking one of my own<br>
