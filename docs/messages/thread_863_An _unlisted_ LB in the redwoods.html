There is a really enjoyable letterbox in the Fall Creek unit of Henry Cowell Redwoods SP, north of Santa Cruz.  NOTE: this one has nothing to do with the Fall Creek Series, which is three LBs in the same area.  The LB I'm talking about is not listed, AFAI can tell, on either of the LB sites.  It *is* listed on geocaching.com, as a letterbox hybrid.  It is a true hybrid: it has a caching logbook, as well as a letterbox stamp.  I got this with a friend last year; a lot of fun, but it was in bad shape.  The owner has since replaced the old container with a metal ammo can.  You do not need a GPSr for it; the coords given are for a starting point, but the owner gives info on parking, and then a series of excellent clues.  It looks easier than it is, but it isn't *that* much tougher.  Here is the URL...<br>

You do not need to be a member of geocaching to access this cache.  The owner knows that I am going to mention this to the LB community, and has given his blessing.  I figured that, rather than dropping this on a larger list, the folks in here would appreciate that this is an opportunity to expand their horizons a bit.  And Santa Cruz is a nice weekend destination from SoCal :-)<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
