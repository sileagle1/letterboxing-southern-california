&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm sitting here at my desk, trying to wade through a few hundred e-mails - and <br/>
&gt; I notice a stack of papers has burn marks on them?? What??<br/>
&gt; There is a window to my left, and the stack of papers is on a file cabinet <br/>
&gt; pretty level with the window - I don't smoke, I don't have candles here . . . <br/>
&gt; then it dawns on me - somehow my light-up magnifying glass (attached to my desk <br/>
&gt; should I ever find time to carve - ha ha) has gotten turned around and was in <br/>
&gt; such a position that the sun was coming through it, at one point in the <br/>
&gt; afternoon, and doing the "death ray" thing on those papers!<br/>
&gt; It actually got hot enough to burn the edge of one of the papers about six <br/>
&gt; inches! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Scary thing is - we were gone all weekend, including Monday, to AZ :-O<br/>

Well...actually it HAS happened before, at the San Diego gathering a few years<br/>
ago.<br/>
Don was doing a carving demonstration and had brought a large hands-free<br/>
magnifier. During the demo he suddenly said "Something's burning!" and<br/>
everybody looked up and yellled "It's YOU!"<br/>
