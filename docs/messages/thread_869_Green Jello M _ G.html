I love sharing the experiences &amp; stories &amp; putting a face with the trail name!<br/>

So after leaving the M&amp;G...I spent the evening taking my son to the ER..he was playing broomball with his youth group &amp; fell on the ice, and (it turns out) breaking his wrist. <br/>

Such a memorable night..both good &amp; bad. But everything must have some ying/yang right??<br/>

My son's in college &amp; him trying to write his math homework was challenging today. I think I'll be his personal secretary to write it out for him (God knows I can't do that level of math anymore) while his cast is on for the next month.<br/>
 FUN FUN!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, Kelsung... I used to play broomball (aka: broom hockey) back in my early 20s.  I never got injured, but then again, not being very athletic, another girl and I hung around the goalie area and chatted until the action came our way, thus greatly reducing the potential for cardio vascular fitness (and also injury).  We had a WONDERFUL time... and years later, that same girl was my son's kindergarten teacher.<br/>
<br/>
That was at the ill-fated West Covina Ice Skating Rink, gone some 20 years now... and actually, my husband's office is in part of the spot that used to house the skating rink.<br/>
<br/>
Ice is a lot farther from me now.... I LOVED broom hockey!<br/>

P.S. (How long ago did you move here from Michigan?)<br/>
