                    <div class="plaintext-content">the kids & I might actually be back...  Bella finally chose a trailname a while back (Ding Dong Bell), drew a bell, and I carved it, but because our newest boxer is still kinda young (2 1/2), it's been hard to get back out there.  We did scout a Lee & Nancy box, but got interrupted by a local (good thing I had such a great homeschooling science lesson cover story), and I'm itching to go back & get it.  Archer Boy and I scouted a couple of local boxes a few weeks ago, and today, with Mr Deanna along to help keep a lookout, we picked them up!<br>
<br>
Nice, quick drivebys, with good clues and nice stamps...  You know the type, where you scan the area, and a voice in your head says, "it's gotta be...  right... about... THERE," and it is?  Sweet!  <br>
<br>
So if you see my Palm Tree with it's Celtic knot, or Archer Boy's bow & arrow, don't be surprised to see a little bell, with a 6 year old's "DING" written alongside.  And I have to say thank you to those who have been planting, because there are a lot more to find than there was a few years ago!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are in Colton, at the 215/10.  Never did finish the Redlands Park Series (but we will), we have a plan for Citrus, & the Fontana boxes are pretty close.  Having three kids in tow, I try to plan boxes during a trip, like I have to drive out to Rancho Cuca in a few weeks to hit the Dance store.  Archer Boy is 11 now, and is getting good at spotting that SPOR (even when it's not a rock), from the car even.  It helps to have a second pair of trained eyes...<br>
<br>
Was hoping to get up to the Kern this year, but Mr D's best friend decided to fight cancer instead.  <br>
<br>
Maybe we'll finally get around to planting.  You know, Colton wouldn't be here if it weren't for the trains...  And the Earp brothers?  Local history...  <br>
