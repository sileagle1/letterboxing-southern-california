<br>
The planter was Aljan Sundance from Colorado.  She inquired of me a while back about planting and adopting a replacement.  As of this weekend, that has taken place.  Once she posts the clues, I encourage all of you to check out "Sweet Candied Death" in East Los Angeles.  It is a really cool stamp with a handmade logbook.<br>
<br>
And it's in a beautiful old graveyard:  Go in the sunny afternoon.<br>

PS  I may as well shamelessly plug the fact that I also replaced my missing "Scuplture Park" box while I was at it, not too far away.<br>
