I think I may go down to Ontario on the 16th and see about doing some LBing with KK during the day, that way I can pick my son up from school on the way back home.  She doesn't have a car with her, so I could drive her around in the "Quest" mobile.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks - I'll take a look - hopefully going to get to do some LBing while camping at El Capitan State Beach this weekend - I'm taking 5 with me to plant and looking at 8 sitting here waiting to go when I get back (and "yes" Lee, one is "Bob's" - hanging head in embarrassment) - wanna come help :-P<br/>
I'll be in the San Pedro area next Friday night and Saturday morning/afternoon if anybody wants to hang out??<br/>

With only a few hours, those seven new boxes (basically drive-bys) are probably your best bet:<br/>

The Finish Line<br/>
Water Of Life Fontana<br/>
Fontana Yankees<br/>
Gotta Have A Slurpee<br/>
Rosena Park East<br/>
Eye C U<br/>
The Hollynator<br/>

&gt; I won't get to join you guys that evening :-(Â Â  so will check out the Fontana ones on AQ (thank you) - any other suggestions?Â Â  <br/>
&gt; We'll only have a few hours as I have to back to the Phelan/Pinon Hills area by 3:00 - darn responsibilities! :-P<br/>

&gt; I'll be meeting up with DKK that evening, too. Are you gonna hit up all those new boxes around Fontana?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Absolutely loved the Halloween costumes and pumpkins!!Ã‚Â  Including the little pooper pumpkin ;-}<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think I may go down to Ontario on the 16th and see about doing some LBing with KK during the day, that way I can pick my son up from school on the way back home.Ã‚Â  She doesn't have a car with her, so I could drive her around in the "Quest" mobile.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'll be in Death Valley on the 21st, so won't be able to see the Monkey's :-{<br/>

&gt; &gt; I won't be able to make it middle of the week to Ontario, but the Monkeys from San Jose are going to be in our area around Thanksgiving. I met them when I was in San Jose, so once I get a better idea of their availability, I will set something up.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh, and since Halloween is my favorite holiday...<br/>
