Anybody who has checked out my "Freeway Chickens" letterbox would know that it <br/>
was disappointing both for me as a planter and you as finders to not actually <br/>
find any of the legendary chickens.<br/>
<br/>
Well today I was in that area for my job, so I stopped by and checked up on the <br/>
box.  But when I went to get back on the freeway, I had to take a different <br/>
entrance to get to my work destination that I'd never taken before.  And, Lo and <br/>
Behold, that's where they were!  It's stupid just how excited I got over this <br/>
discovery!<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I'll soon be moving my box a few blocks and updating the clues!<br/>

I have to say my trip to the original box wasn't disappointing at all! =-)<br/>
I'll be eager to have a look at the actual chickens when you re-post the clues, though!<br/>
