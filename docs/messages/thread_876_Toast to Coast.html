I would love to reunite with the folks I met last year and perhaps meet some new boxers. I arrive the 17 and was thinking Saturday the 18 would be a good day. I also see several new boxes have been planted. I am open to suggestions on which ones might be fun to grab in my limited time.<br>

As you put in the listing, "Maybe work out a boxing day with PB&J on Mon. or Tuesday", I like that idea. I'm going to sign up for the event.<br>
