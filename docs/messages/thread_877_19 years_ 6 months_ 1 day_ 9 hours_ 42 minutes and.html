Now that I get it, it seems so obvious I'm kicking myself.  I should have had it by the second hint.  After a few months, I think I was focusing too much on the hints, and not still looking at the actual clue.  Everything you need to find the box is right there, no hints required.<br/>

All hail Lee &amp; Nancy, masters of the mini-clue.<br/>

&gt; I was able to get a couple new boxes planted though.  In some ways the exact location of a letterbox is like an exact moment in time.  Hopefully it will take Kelsung quite a few moments to figure out the clues to my new Lamppost letterbox. <br/>
