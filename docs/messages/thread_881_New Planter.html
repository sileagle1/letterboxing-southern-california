Okay, so I have to recommend a couple new boxes:  Lobito's Lair and Daruma Box.  The planter is Mr. Muggins, and according to their AQ profile they are brand new, but I'm not buying it.  Both of these boxes are just too good.<br>
<br>
The first is a pretty straightforward short hike in a little known park near downtown L.A.  A couple boxes used to be here years ago but are long gone, so it's nice to have a new one.  The carve is really cool, and the box explains that it's based on an actual local animal.<br>
<br>
The second give you a great tour of Little Tokyo, including several historical points, and personal recommendations for both lunch and an obscure bar.  The clues were a lot of fun to follow, and the two part stamp, with detailed explanation, was awesome.<br>

PS  While I'm at it, check out Cold Feet in Burbank.  I adopted it from Sitzmak, but it's all her original box.<br>

I remember hunting for the Elyria Canyon boxes after the 100-year rains in 2005 when the canyon was so overgrown the trail was just a narrow path with 6 foot chaparral closing in on both sides so thick you could only see a few yards ahead and behind you. Plus there had been some serious mudslides. It was so creepy I finally had to turn back. It will be interesting to see how it looks now. <br>
<br>
Thanks for the heads up!<br>
