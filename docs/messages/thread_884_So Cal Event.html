The basic idea is to have six teams (Plum, Mustard, etc.) going after 21 boxes, each containing a stamp of a card, narrowing down which three are not going to be found.  The first team to figure out the final solution will get clues to the final box.  These will all be temporary plants for a one-day event.<br>

<br>
It will be six teams (Scarlett, Mustard, White, Green, Peacock, Plum) and ideally I'm thinking 3 or 4 people each.  Minimum of two, because the servants will be whispering bonus clues to you and you may want to split up as the game progresses.  Two couples (or two pairs of platonic friends) would probably be ideal.<br>
<br>
So start thinking now which team you'd like to be and with whom, because once I post the event listing, it will be first-come first-served.  I don't want to hurt any feelings, but that's just the only way it will work.  And I think it would be cool if everyone wore matching color T-shirts!<br>

Would love to... But not feeling like the sharpest pencil in the box... Put me on a sharp team, if I get to come.  Also, for what it's worth, April 2nd works, but plenty of conflicts on our calendar for April 9th.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Kelsung, for planning ahead so far.<br>

First, because I want this to move in a timely fashion.  It will be a competition for which team can figure out the final solution first.<br>
<br>
Second, I'll need to provide a specific logbook to players, allowing one stamp per page.  Because, you know, you may have to show a card to another team.  I only want to make two per team (in case you split up).<br>
<br>
Third, since the trails will be close to one another (even overlapping) you want small groups, to minimize one team seeing where another may be looking for a box. Don't want any cheating.<br>
<br>
As you can see, OCD nut-job that I am, I've already put a lot of thought into this.  I started hatching the idea in early December.  I've already got most of the stamps carved and most of the clues written.<br>

Can you kinda give me a heads up the vicinity the event will be held in.  Not the park or anything but something that will give me an idea of where i should book my hotel. <br>
Like South Bay,Riverside,San Pedro,Orange,Sherman Oaks? A general feel for where so i don't have to play too much on those things called freeways.<br>

I'd be honored to have you and your husband, Tara. I have fond memories of finding Travis' Box and Barbara's Box in my early days of boxing.<br>
<br>
To answer your question, yes I have seen many folks walking their dogs at this park. It has many short, interconnected trails that are mostly paved and level, suitable for young ones or strollers, but I would discourage bringing them as the game is a race, to some extent. If you do choose to, however, I wouldn't count them as one of the four on your team.<br>
