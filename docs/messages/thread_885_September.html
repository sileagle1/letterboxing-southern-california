Allemeyn will be back down this way in Sept. and is hoping to meet up with us :-) ???<br>
Hopefully he'll be more specific as the time draws near . . . . .<br>
which reminds me - Kelsung, what's up with your Adventure??<br>
Deniserows was wondering where it might be so she can get a room close by - me too :-)<br>

My intention is to post an event listing on AQ on March 1st.  What I think would work best is that when people sign up, they can use the "potluck item" field to put in what team they want to be.  Obviously, if someone before you has taken the one you wanted, go with your second choice.<br>
<br>
My worry is that on the day of the event, something unforeseen may come up and someone might not show up.  For the game to work, I NEED six teams, so I may need to do some last-minute shifting around.  Hopefully that won't be an issue, but I thought it made sense to bring the idea up early so nobody is surprised.<br>
<br>
When I list it, I can put the city.  But should I hold off revealing the exact location until a few days before?  Should I worry that someone might go there beforehand and familiarize themselves with the trails?  I don't know how much difference it will make.  Am I being paranoid?<br>

I know, I know, I over-think things...<br>

Okay - so how about just the closest town with hotels on March 1st?<br>
