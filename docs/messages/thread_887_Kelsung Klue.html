                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a lovely Spring day!  Nothing could disturb the pleasure of those wispy clouds and chirping birds.  Except, perhaps, murder!<br/>
<br/>
You were one of a group of socialites invited to spend the day at Tudor Manor, the estate of Mr. John Boddy.  A fine dinner party would, of course, commence in the evening.  Meanwhile, each house guest whiled away the afternoon in various ways: reading in the library, playing piano in the ballroom, perhaps going for a horseback ride about the grounds.<br/>
<br/>
But suddenly, the blood-curdling scream of a horrified man rang throughout the mansion!  Within moments, all the servants and guests were assembling in the corridors, anxious to know what had happened.  The ever-attentive butler whisked them all out to the patio around the pool and disappeared back inside.<br/>
<br/>
Moments later he returned and quickly dialed the police.  Everyone gasped in shock as he requested an inspector be sent round to investigate an incident of foul play:  Mr. Boddy was dead!  He hung up and announced that no one was to leave the area.<br/>
<br/>
Soon the Inspector arrived, talked briefly with the servants, and proceeded to search the house as everyone sat about the pool, murmuring questions to one another.  He returned with his arms full and dumped a pile of items on a table.  Announcing that one of these things was in fact the murder weapon, he proceeded to take each house guest aside one by one and question them.<br/>
<br/>
At that point, nobody knew by what means Mr. Boddy was murdered, nor even in what room of the manor the crime had taken place.  It became clear that this was a deliberate ploy by the Inspector to smoke out the culprit, hoping that they would accidentally reveal themselves upon questioning.<br/>
<br/>
Your own curiosity, of course, had you listening to the whispers of the servants.  With the Inspector distracted by his interviews, perhaps you would slip out and do some investigating of your own and try to piece together where each person and item had been when you all heard Mr. Boddy scream.<br/>

I see I wasn't the only one to stay up until midnight to get a spot!  Looks like there are more boxers as excited as I am for this one Kelsung :)<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait! I'd better be able to get to sleep now, I have to get up for work at 5...and I've got visions of professor plums dancing in my head! :D<br/>

Kelsung's hard work was so appreciated! Yes, it was a mighty well run event and the turn out was super, mostly thou, it was all about the very sweet and friendly folks who make up our letterboxing community.  Thanks for getting us together!      It was great to see some new folks as well as to reaccquaint with <br/>
dear ones from gatherings of the past.    Love, Gwen<br/>
