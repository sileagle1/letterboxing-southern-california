Thank you to everyone who wanted to be on a team with me- at least I think Hansenclan wanted to be on my team??<br>
It did say something about, "Cut-up Fruit paired with Dezert Ratty . .." !!!<br>
I don't know, that doesn't sound too good to me - hee hee<br>
Thanks Kelsung for all of your hard work :-) <br>
I'm really looking forward to seeing everybody down there on the 9th :-)<br>
Woo Hoo!!!<br>

Alright, the teams are posted. I tried to balance factors like experience and babies. And I got Lee to defect to Team Plum so Hansen won't need to worry that the kids are a handicap. All in all I think you're evenly matched.<br>
