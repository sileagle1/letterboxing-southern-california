                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everybody... I have a little leverage with my family right now, since we haven't celebrated my February birthday yet.  Normally I use it to arrange for us all to have a weekend away together -- San Diego for about 6 years, Redlands last year.  This year I just want to go hiking (and letterboxing, of course).  April 2nd is the target date.<br>
<br>
I'm 49... hubby sometimes has creaky knees, daughter's okay but not enthusiastic, son is 11 and slow to keep up...  I'm trying to decide between these two locales:<br>
<br>
1.  Chantry Flats/Sturtevant (sp?) Falls -- I've done this before (but not in the past 18+ years), so know it's a fun and relatively easy hike, with the exception of the climb back up the hill at the end.  But a few letterboxes were planted there last year, which sweetens the deal, and our kids have never been there.  The falls ought to be beautiful, thanks to the recent rains.<br>
<br>
2.  Eaton Canyon (above Pasadena?) -- Have never been there, and never heard about it until it showed up on the Letterboxing Radar.  Curious, but don't know how strenuous/long it is, compared to #1, above.<br>
<br>
Suggestions?  Feedback?  Something that won't kill the last shred of enthusiasm the rest of my family has, for hiking?  I wiped them out with the 4 mile hike at Crystal Cove last Spring.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>

Your memory of the hike is accurate: easy until that last hill.  The boxes there are nice and the waterfall is totally worth it.  There is also another somewhat forgotten box there.  But it's a hike in the other direction and probably best left for a second trip:<br>

<br>
Well, depending which boxes you are going for, this starts very easy.  If you're going to the Threedigs box adopted by California Bear, that will be a short, easy hike.  If you add to that the Walnut Canyon box from Buzzard's "Other Canyons" series, which is nearby, that hike gets a little hairy toward the end.  But both are worth it just for the age of the boxes alone.<br>
<br>
But if you want to continue all the way to the falls and the Hummingbird box, that's a much longer and more difficult hike.  Not really that difficult of a hike, but relative to the first half.  And this box is all uphill from Eaton with very little shade:<br>
<br>

<br>
So, in summary, if it's a one-time shot to keep the noxers interested, I'd go with Chantry Flats.  But keep Eaton Canyon on your to-do list.  Buffalo Tony actually planted a box along the way when we went to get the Hummingbird last year, but he never posted the clues, so I may need to make that one a word-of-mouth box.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Eaton canyon is beautiful and there is a place to get you closer to the falls than parking near the nature center. This cuts out most of the non-shaded part of the hike. But don't go right after heavy rains as the places where you cross the water won't be so easy.<br>

2260 Pinecrest Dr. Altadena, CA<br>
To get to the Pinecrest gate, go north on Altadena Drive one mile past the entrance to Eaton Canyon.  Turn right on Crescent, then right again on Pinecrest.  Observe parking signs carefully.<br>
<br>
Hiking directions :<br>
Pass through the gate and down the road about 0.2 mile. Cross the bridge and veer right on path (but you will end up going left at ground level). You can use the steep path immediately on the right to descend directly from the end of bridge to the canyon-bottom trail, or you can continue on the road briefly to find a couple other routes that are more gentle. Once at the canyon-bottom trail, proceed up canyon under the bridge.  As you continue up canyon, the route crosses the creek many times, tied together by short stretches of rustic trail. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree completely with Kelsung's appraisal.  If had to choose between Chantry Flat and Eaton Canyon *right now* (well, not *right* now; it's raining, again...) I would take Chantry Flat, once all threat of more rain is past.  As lifetish pointed out, there are several stream crossings in Eaton Canyon, and with all the rain we've had, I don't think it wise to do them, especially for folks not used to them.  <br>
<br>
But I certainly appreciate those directions that lifetish gave; I wasn't aware of that entrance.  Thanks!<br>

This is totally right.  If you are going to do the "Eaton Hummingbird" box at the falls, or go up the Mt Wilson Toll Rd, and this is where Buzzard has you start for the "Henninger Flats Letterbox," but don't do that long grueling hike just to get the box, because it's gone.  The box by Secular Harmony is much easier, maybe a fourth of the way up.<br>
<br>
But if you're going to get the "Other Canyon Series" (of which only Walnut Canyon remains, I believe) or the "Eaton Canyon" box, you need to start at the nature center.<br>

This box came up in a conversation I had with him recently.  He doesn't box much any more (that trip to Eaton was his last big hike) and I will probably be adopting some of his boxes.  But I'll have to get back up there myself to write up the clues, because I didn't take notes on the landmarks since HE was going to list the box.  I know where it is and I'll be able to find it from memory no problem, but I'll have to get back to you on the WOM clue.<br>
