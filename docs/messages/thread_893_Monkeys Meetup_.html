                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
Unfortunately, we'll be missing the Klue event (Grandma has claimed us for the weekend) but we will be in town and can make ourselves available Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday April 13-15. We'll be staying in the Los Feliz/Griffith park area. Would anyone like to help us throw together a casual meetup at a restaurant or something? I'm guessing Friday after most people get off work might be best for most of you? <br>
Hope to meet/re-meet some of you,<br>
-Monkeys! <br>

http://www.yelp.com/biz/house-of-pies-restaurant-and-bakery-los-angeles<br>
<br>
It's just a basic diner, but of all the restaurants in that area, it's probably our best bet on seating for a larger group on a Friday night and wouldn't be expensive.<br>
