  Thank you not only for the best game of KLUE I have ever played (and not won), but for the wonderful artwork I will have in my log book to fondly remember it all.  Such a generous and contagious spirit you are!<br>
<br>
I loved that everyone had the passionate spirit and assertive command of leaders and yet, everyone got along (not so common with so many leaders, eh?).<br>
<br>
I can't believe it has taken me this long to attend an exchange and i am aware that I chose a special one for my first.  Team Peacock, Team Scarlet, Team White, Team Green (congrats again)and Team Plum - how lovely to share the adventure with you all.<br>
<br>
And to my team Mustard - thank you for adopting me into your clan so warmly.  What a wonderful family you all are!  <br>
<br>
I hope everyone else traveled home as safely as I did.  I look forward to seeing you all again sooner than later (if only to share my stamp with the Peacocks I left empty-stamped).  <br>
<br>
And i might just start posting my finds.  Thank you all again!<br>

My feet are cursing me, and I am bone tired - but it was a good weekend all in all :-)<br>
Thank you Thank you -  for ALL of your hard work on this Event.  I have to say it is one that will definitely stay in everybody's mind for a long, long time . . . . <br>
Now, we just have to see about getting a Patch??? <br>
 <br>
Loved seeing everybody and meeting some new folks as well!  Just wish I could have Exchanged with everybody!!<br>
 <br>
Team "Toasted Rats" got a "Bonus" today - while searching around Cedar Grove Park, we met a couple of Gryffindors fresh from the state of Washington!!  We ended up boxing with them until it was time for them to go get lunch (at a certain Elvis themed Mexican restaurant) and time for "Toasted Rats" to head for the park and ride :-)<br>
 <br>
Zuhl - Thank You for loaning us your COD husband, we all appreciate it - and you too!!!  XXXOOOXX<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you to everyone-- especially Kelsung!!  I had a blast, and came away with many fond memories, beautiful stamps, and soreness in places I've never felt before :P  It was so great to put names to faces!  Now I am inspired to seek out some hearty alphabet soup and maybe even start *using* AQ (sorry team Plum).  <br>
<br>
I want to send a special shout-out to everyone involved in the safe return of my phone.  It was such a bummer when my search for letterboxes was abruptly halted and instead turned into a search for my phone.  But alls well that ends well--just part of my adventure, I guess.  :)  <br>
<br>
Nice to meet everyone--that was such a cool idea Kelsung, thank you so much for including me!<br>
