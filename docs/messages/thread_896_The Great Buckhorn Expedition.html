<br>
There is a letterbox by KatPau called Cooper Canyon:<br>
<br>
http://homepage.mac.com/advtrvlr/Cooper/Cooper.html<br>
<br>
The box has been there for seven-and-a-half years, but nobody has ever logged a find online.  This leads to several possible conclusions.<br>
<br>
First, compared to other boxes in So Cal, it is in one of the remotest locations.  Not that it is a particularly long hike (4.4 miles round-trip) but the trailhead is at a campground in the dead center of the Angeles National Forest, the closest civilization being Wrightwood some 30 miles away.  Therefore, although someone may have found it and just not logged it, it is much more likely that nobody has ever sought it out, with so many closer and easier boxes available.<br>
<br>
Second, based on my experience in finding other KatPau plants, there is a strong possibility that it is still viable.  Her boxes tend to be good containers that will hold up for years and in remote locations that are highly unlikely to be uncovered by accident.  Still, we could come up empty-handed, but I think the trip will be worth it.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I'm proposing that we put together a group and hunt down this almost forgotten treasure.  Imagine being the first finder after eight years!  I've done my research:  It was unaffected by the station fire, being 10 miles east of the edge of the damage, and although a few years ago a preserve area was created when some protected tree frogs were discovered, the location of the box should be outside of it.  It is currently inaccessible due to snow, so I'm thinking sometime in early summer 4 or 5 of us could meet for brunch in Wrightwood and then carpool in someone's truck or SUV to the campground.  If more want to join we may need two vehicles, each requiring a Forest Adventure Pass, which is $5 for the day.  We can do the hike and be back by that evening.<br>
<br>
So, who's interested, and which of DZ's dates are you available?<br>
