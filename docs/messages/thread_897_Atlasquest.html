But at least now I look a little more alive! I can't believe that it has been since 2004...no wonder so many aren't listed.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have about 170 finds that aren't listed on AQ and it does let you list unlisted finds.  If you become a premium member (which I am not) you can do this any time.  But 5 random days a year, Ryan lets non-members have a "free listing day".  It will be unannounced, but you will know it by the "hat" theme.  The themes on AQ change pretty regularly, and the hat theme has images of the many hats with a feather in them that you can choose from when you become a premium member.<br>
<br>
The idea is, people who only get on once in a while will probably miss it, but people who use the site regularly and therefore are contributing to the AQ community deserve this little perk even though they use the site for free.  Another thing you can check out on a "hat" day is your statistics, which gives all kinds of fun info, like the average miles you put in between boxes.<br>
