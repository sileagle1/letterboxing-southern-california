Soooo....  Maybe those in the know could meet at Double Helix.  But I suggest those involved discuss such things by private email, lest something about a mystery accidentally slips out....<br>

  I kind of have this all-day-long (14 bands) show in Anaheim on Saturday, but I don't have to be there till noon. So if this little Wassa get-together manages to start somewhere (say, El Retiro Park in Torrance) sometime before then, I could at least manage a couple exchanges and how-do-you-dos before I gotta run. Have any plans been firmed up?<br>
