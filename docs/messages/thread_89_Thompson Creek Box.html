Are you saying you've recently found the Grey Squirril's Rancho Santa <br/>
Ana Botanical Gardens LB?  'Cos I was positive I looked for it in the <br/>
right place months ago, and found it missing. But I've missed boxes <br/>
before.<br/>

Yes, We were there yesterday. It's still there. Let me know if you <br/>
need help to find it. A first we spent about 1 1/2 hours looking for <br/>
it. So don't feel bad. Purple Iris.-<br/>

Well that really chaps my hide.  It was one of the first stamps I <br/>
ever looked for, so maybe I can blame missing it on inexperience. I <br/>
also spent that day looking for another Squirrel box planted in Frank <br/>
G. Bonnelli Park, also without success.  I've injured my leg, and am <br/>
on the mend, but when I'm feeling better I'd love to meet you out <br/>
there for an exchange, and to help me find the box.  I also promised <br/>
the French Hen I wouldn't letterbox for the next few weeks so I could <br/>
concentrate on the holidays.  She was so happy at my compliance with <br/>
this request, she took pity on me and suggested we go out this <br/>
morning and track down the Agriscapes Letterbox, which was just <br/>
placed a few days ago in Pomona by Sierra Sally--we were 1st Stamp!!<br/>
