The funniest part of my day was when I exchanged with Pat and she asked how long I'd been doing this.  I said since 2005, to which she said "Wow," but Gwen said "Newbie!"  :)<br>

I would be happy to give a carving workshop but I truly don't know what I could teach any of you.  I think everyone carves beautifully.  If anyone wants to get together to carve, eat, carve, tell letterboxing stories, carve, eat, etc.  I'm game.  We could do it at my house and I'll even hide some LBs around so you have an excuse to get up and wonder around.  Let me know if there is any interest and I'll put it together.<br>

The few events that I have done has really shown me that the wonderful comradeship continues from when I first started.  Thank you Kelsung for all your enthusiasm and kindness.  You and everyone that attended yesterday are who make this "game/hobby" so great.  <br>
