<br>
Everybody counts things a little different, and I personally include personal travelers in my F count (Just because it wasn't in the wild somewhere, I still solved a clue to get a stamp!) so I was over 1000 back in February, and by my count I'm at 1098!<br>
<br>
...Then you see someone like lost sailor who already has that many, and has only been boxing since last July!!!  Of course, he lost his job around the same time he discovered boxing, so it's all he does.  There's a brief interview with him on the latest letterpod, which is accidentally missing my interview by deniserows from Kelsung Klue.  Ah, well...<br>
