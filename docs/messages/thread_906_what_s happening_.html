Life and The Real World keep intruding; I've had almost no time over the past few weeks for any treasure hunts of any kind, and certainly not for hiding things.  I have several stamps ready to go, and I know the general area where I want to hide two of them, and I have an idea for a stamp for a different spot, but actually carving it, or getting out and doing anything with the others, is way down on the priority list, unfortunately.  The next two weekends don't look promising, either.  So It Goes; Family comes first.<br>

However, if all goes well, you should have a new series to hunt in Griffith Park after tomorrow.  And by new, I mean a very old one being replanted.  I'll give full details once we (yes, "we": it's a group project) have it posted.<br>

I'll definitely keep my eyes on this area, as it's less than an hour from home, and we (or at least I) drive up that way quite frequently.  Spending a day there boxing (and caching), especially with summer coming on, sounds like fun :-)<br>

Or so we thought :-p  Our high-school-aged oldest grandson, Justin, has been staying with us and our middle daughter, Shannon, who is the only one of our three girls to live near us.  Neither she nor Justin's parents (our oldest, Bethany, and son-in-law Jason) have internet access, and most of his schoolwork is on-line.  He got way behind, so he's been spending many days here, trying to catch up.  He made tremendous progress in Geometry (he grasps it quickly once it's explained), and I got him in the groove as far as how to handle World History, which is not a favorite subject.  Unfortunately, he's going to have to punt Chemistry, but I can't see how anyone can do well in that by doing almost all of the work on-line.  At least we got two of his teachers to unlock most of the work, so that he can keep working over the Summer.  There are no summer sessions in Nye County, Nevada, which I guess makes sense, considering how hot it gets there in July and August.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I can commiserate with you on this; getting kids to finish stuff at the end of a school year is never easy.  Hope it all works out :-)<br>

Hi there all - just got back from a crazy weekend Fri/Sat at Santa Fe Dam - our Boy Scout Troop hosts a 25/50/100 mile bicycle ride with stops at Legg Lake (Whittier Narrows), El Dorado Park and the Park across from the Queen Mary????  <br>
Anyway, the kid was going to do the 50 and at the last minute went for the 100 - and he did it!  But that meant I was there for the duration.<br>
and since I was sitting there most the day, tracking the comings and goings and feeding the 25 milers - I was thinking it's too bad I didn't carve a couple stamps!   <br>
Then I found out it cost $10.00 to get in???  We all came in the back gate with our handy dandy gate key -  aah well<br>
 <br>
Kelsung - I am glad to hear you are okay and just working, working, working - are we putting the Expedition on hold till the end of summer??<br>
 <br>
Chaosmanor - thanks for the Good luck :-)  Nothing like hunting your own stamps :-P<br>
 <br>
Alarch - Vinegar!!  My Grandma's cure for everything :-)<br>
 <br>
Hansenclan - mine just finished school on Friday - now the Football practice begins . . . . . Hope yours got everything turned in on time :-)<br>
 <br>
CherryonTop - see what you started - ha ha<br>
 <br>
I'll be back your way tomorrow - gotta buy the Grad a car - I bought my first car for $350.00 - we're trying to get her something for around $4,500.00 - I tell ya, if you have a 20 year old car that gets good gas mileage - now is the time to sell!   It's ridiculous<br>
 <br>
Good night, one and all, from one wore out old Ratty    <br>

Or so we thought :-p Our high-school-aged oldest grandson, Justin, has been staying with us and our middle daughter, Shannon, who is the only one of our three girls to live near us. Neither she nor Justin's parents (our oldest, Bethany, and son-in-law Jason) have internet access, and most of his schoolwork is on-line. He got way behind, so he's been spending many days here, trying to catch up. He made tremendous progress in Geometry (he grasps it quickly once it's explained), and I got him in the groove as far as how to handle World History, which is not a favorite subject. Unfortunately, he's going to have to punt Chemistry, but I can't see how anyone can do well in that by doing almost all of the work on-line. At least we got two of his teachers to unlock most of the work, so that he can keep working over the Summer. There are no summer sessions in Nye County, Nevada, which I guess makes sense, considering how hot it gets there in July and August.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I can commiserate with you on this; getting kids to finish stuff at the end of a school year is never easy. Hope it all works out :-)<br>

Oh, no, dear.  I've had that date reserved since you first suggested it.  And I've called the Grizzly Cafe and confirmed it will be okay to leave a few vehicles in their lot for the afternoon.  I've updated info on the AQ event page, but wasn't going to mention it until I was able to call on Monday to be sure the Burkhart trail is accessible during the renovation you mentioned.  Between your van and Lee's truck, I think we're covered.<br>
<br>
So Saturday the 18th is still on.  But then I have an all day gig on Sunday...<br>

> Or so we thought :-p Our high-school-aged oldest grandson, Justin, has been staying with us and our middle daughter, Shannon, who is the only one of our three girls to live near us. Neither she nor Justin's parents (our oldest, Bethany, and son-in-law Jason) have internet access, and most of his schoolwork is on-line. He got way behind, so he's been spending many days here, trying to catch up. He made tremendous progress in Geometry (he grasps it quickly once it's explained), and I got him in the groove as far as how to handle World History, which is not a favorite subject. Unfortunately, he's going to have to punt Chemistry, but I can't see how anyone can do well in that by doing almost all of the work on-line. At least we got two of his teachers to unlock most of the work, so that he can keep working over the Summer. There are no summer sessions in Nye County, Nevada, which I guess makes sense, considering how hot it gets there in July and August.<br>

Stinging Nettles Remedy: mud from a nearby stream.  Of course, Stinging Nettles doesn't limit itself to growing in Riparian habitats, so you may not always have a stream nearby... Sorry about the nettles...<br>

By the way all - great success today - after only three weeks of car hunting a used Saturn was purchased for the college grad AND it was only $34.00 over our budget :-P<br>
Now everybody keep their fingers crossed the thing keeps running until she has her college loans paid off!!!!<br>

Oh, no, dear. I've had that date reserved since you first suggested it. And I've called the Grizzly Cafe and confirmed it will be okay to leave a few vehicles in their lot for the afternoon. I've updated info on the AQ event page, but wasn't going to mention it until I was able to call on Monday to be sure the Burkhart trail is accessible during the renovation you mentioned. Between your van and Lee's truck, I think we're covered.<br>
<br>
So Saturday the 18th is still on. But then I have an all day gig on Sunday...<br>
