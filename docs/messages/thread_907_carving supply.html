                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's a long way from your neck of the woods but if you ever wander into the LA area, Swain's is the absolute art toy store.  (And they also have a cool toy dept.) <br>
It's in Glendale, close to Griffith Park.<br>
They have the pink stuff and used to carry Master Carve, but right now have Moo Carve instead. Best time to go is at the beginning of the semester when they have their big sale.<br>
Michael's is great but I try to support independent retailers as much as possible. <br>
