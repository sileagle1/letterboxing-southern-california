                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, a couple of important points have come to light.<br/>
<br/>
First, access to the 2 has just recently been reopened from La Canada Flintridge and second, there seems to be some renovation going on at Buckhorn Campground.  I'm going to confirm with the rangers whether it is open all the way to Buckhorn from La Canada, and also whether we can access the Burkhart Trail.  The trail head has a parking lot at the campground, but I don't think we actually need to access the campground to get to the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to the bad news that may make some of you no longer interested in this "expedition" of mine.  I'd read this a long time ago, but when I'd started asking Lee and Dezert Ratty about 2 access this spring, I'd forgotten all about it.  On the main page of KatPau's letterbox site, in the summary for Cooper Canyon, it states that the stamp was stolen by a geocacher.  Keep in mind, this is a site that hasn't changed in several years, so that's really old information.  I don't hold a lot of hope that it was replaced, but if the logbook is still there, I'm still interested.  I may even bring some carving material and if there's a stamp image in the logbook, I'll carve a replacement.<br/>
<br/>
In light of all this information, I want to know what others think, as we have only 10 days to finalize our exact plans for the day.<br/>

Angeles Forest Highway to reopen Friday (6/3/2011)<br/>
http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/06/02/angeles-forest-highway-reopen-soon/<br/>
<br/>
Angeles Crest Highway (SR-2) is open to motorists.<br/>
http://twitter.com/#!/CaltransDist7/status/76779575937478656<br/>
<br/>
The hike<br/>
http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-angeles-national-forest-hiking-los-angeles-san-bernardino-sidwcmdev_056933.html<br/>
http://tchester.org/sgm/hikes/js/buckhorn_3.html#falls<br/>
<br/>
Be aware that Buckhorn Campground can also be closed due to snow. The hike can still be done by parking along SR2 which will add a total length of 0.7 miles to the hike. <br/>
http://tchester.org/sgm/links/62.html<br/>
<br/>
Also Nancy traded in her Truck for a Ford Edge.  It comfortable seats four adults (no third row seat).  She will LET ME take it, provided I do not take it down narrow road/trails where branches may scratch the sides, and more importantly, that we do not track tree sap into the vehicle.  You can still count me in even if the box or stamp may be missing (assuming Kelung will have an event stamp at least).  Since Kelsung is prepared to create a replacement stamp, I will bring a new container, logbook, and ziplock bags, in case they are needed.  Looking forward to the hike.<br/>

Anyway,  With the opening of Hwy. 2, will all of us still be meeting at the Grizzly Cafe - which, BTW, has very tasty fare - or at the trail head?  If I remember correctly, Buckhorn is about 45 minutes from the restaurant?<br/>

That was kinda my point.  I think those of us down here (me, Clarinet, PP and Alarch) could carpool up from our end in a vehicle and the rest of you (Lee, DR, Sky) meet at Grizzly and come in a vehicle from the other side.  That's sort of where my head is at, I just don't know if we have a single vehicle that can hold all of us down here.<br/>
