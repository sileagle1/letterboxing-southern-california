thought this box would be ok being that it was so close to the <br/>
houses, but the entire area right up to the backyard fences is <br/>
burned. <br/>
We did find the plastic baggie that held the stamp ( you could tell <br/>
because of the ink on the inside) But all else is gone. The immediate <br/>
area where the box was is not scorched the trees are burned but the <br/>
ground is ok. The rocks are all scattered. So i think someone found <br/>
the box and just took it??? Maybe the firemen.<br/>
Speaking of the firemen, I can't imagine the struggle it must have <br/>
been to save these homes.<br/>
<br/>
I also checked the Santa Ana Botanical Gardens box and that one is A-<br/>
ok. Not near the fire and it is just fine. Purple Iris<br/>
