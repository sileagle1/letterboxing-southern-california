Desert Ratty and I will meet up in wrightwood (Grizzly Cafe - not sure what time) and meet the southern group at the trail head if we can get into the campground, or at the start of the campground road along SR-2 if it is closed (Again at what time?  Not sure how long to get from Wrightwood to campground).<br>
<br>
I already have an Adventure Pass.  Since only two from the North, I will bring my car, and see which vehicle Desert Ratty prefers to take.<br>
Also wanted to confirm that Kelsung did an event stamp? Yes, I hope.<br>
Looking forward to the hike.<br>

I suppose you expected me to be carving while we hike, right?<br>
<br>
I got it from a ranger that we can access the trail head no problem even though the campground is closed.  As for the time, I don't want to say TOO early, because we all have to get there, but I don't want to start too late.  Even though it will be cooler up in the mountains, it is still June, but then again it should be a pretty shady hike, too, so I'm not that worried about mid-day heat.<br>
<br>
How about we be to the trail head at around 10:30?  Is that too late?  Too early?<br>

Anyway, Lee - I will hopefully have my friend - Lone Buffalo - with me, she and I can meet you at 0930 at Grizzly Cafe and we can take my car to BH, we can meet earlier up to you??<br>
I think BH is about 32 - 40 miles from GC in Wrightwood.<br>
Okay, so that brings up another topic - since the majority of you will be coming from the opposite way - should we all pack our own lunches to have after the hike?<br>
Let me know what you think - Dezert Ratty<br>

<br>
Yes, I think that's a good idea.  Eat before we drive into the mountains, then work up an appetite hiking and eat again.  Sounds like a great lifestyle to me.  Throw in some clues that lead to rubber stamps and I might think of doing this on a regular basis. ;)<br>
<br>
The ironic thing in all this is that it started with me trying to figure out how to get to Cooper Canyon in spite of the 2 being closed, but just before we finally get around to it, it reopens.<br>

Here's how many miles that has saved me:<br>

SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE TO DRIVE THRU CAMPGROUND TO GET TO TRAILHEAD, ELSE HIKE .7 MILES FROM HWY-2.  I SUGGEST WE MEET AT 10:30 WHERE WE CAN PARK (TRAILHEAD IF POSSIBLE, OR OFF HWY-2) SO WE ALL HIKE TOGETHER, AND CAN ESTIMATE ARRIVAL TIME BETTER.<br>

<br>
GREAT IDEA, ALSO ALLOWS KELSUNG TO CARVE THE EVENT STAMP WHILE SITTING, INSTEAD OF WHILE HIKING.  SAFETY FIRST.<br>

CAN'T WAIT.<br>

As for the time, I don't want to say TOO early, because we all have to get there, but I don't want to start too late. Even though it will be cooler up in the mountains, it is still June, but then again it should be a pretty shady hike, too, so I'm not that worried about mid-day heat.<br>

Not to say they're gone, because vague clues that are years out of date aren't easy.  I drove along Angeles Crest, Angeles Forest and Big Tujunga but could find no sign, one tunnel and several bridges.  If you want to take a look, the clue is in the basement, and I adopted it last year, with hope twinkling in my eyes.<br>

After crossing the Big Tujunga Narrows Bridge, originally named the Armstrong Bridge (1, p. 202), which rises 275' above the canyon bottom, there is a large turnout on the east side of the road. Park here and quickly scamper across the road to the lookout on the west side. The lookout is nicely constructed of river rock and gives the feeling of being in a crenellated castle. Lizards are the only inhabitants. You can look down into the deep gorge and see the ribbon of refreshing green alder trees in summer. Try to imagine how much work this stream has done carving this deep, steep canyon out of the resistant rock! Floods periodically scour the canyon and debris fills the reservoir behind the dam lower down. The vegetation was recently destroyed by fire.<br>
Next the road passes through a tunnel, sometimes marked on maps as the Singing Springs Tunnel. At the tunnel's south entrance are rocks of banded gneiss, 1,700 million years old, some of the oldest rock found in these mountains (2, p. 110). The road cuts through a ridge separating the Big Tujunga from its tributary, Mill Creek. From this point, the Angeles Forest Highway follows the west side of Mill Creek.<br>

I went after the two Hamish Macbeth boxes last week (just been waiting for the 2 to open up) along with Vienna's two, but came up empty handed. Not to say they're gone, because vague clues that are years out of date aren't easy. I drove along Angeles Crest, Angeles Forest and Big Tujunga but could find no sign, one tunnel and several bridges. If you want to take a look, the clue is in the basement, and I adopted it last year, with hope twinkling in my eyes.<br>
