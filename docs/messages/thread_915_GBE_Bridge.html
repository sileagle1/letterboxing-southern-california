Well it does say "bridge" and "overpass"...hmmm<br/>
Hugging the wall..walls don't grow in 8 years  ;-P   but the bush sure could. Might have even been a baby tree.<br/>
I'm open to theories!<br/>
Glad your ankle and heel are walkable...take care!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, we hugged the wall on the way up, and the bush was at the end.  The next line says to get behind it, and be careful if you go ON the overpass, which is just what I did.  We took into account how the bush could have grown over the years and got way in towards the base.  But the whole area was loose rocks that have slid down the hillside over the years, which is why I think it may be there, but buried.  It would take some serious excavation to be certain.<br/>

Hi Jon,<br/>
<br/>
I will forward your concerns about the rangers  needing to be informed:<br/>
<br/>
Here is info I received about the Burkhart Trail:<br/>
<br/>
The Burkhardt Trail is open, but we are trying to dissuade people from accessing it from Buckhorn Campground as it is still an active construction site.  However, according to Mike McIntyre, the Buckhorn Campground is not administratively closed, so hikers can technically access the Burkhardt Trail through the campground.  To prevent any confusion and to curtail any safety issues, I have been suggesting that people access the Burkhardt Trail/Cooper Canyon Falls via Cloudburst Summit.<br/>
<br/>
The Burkhardt Trail is considered to be within the Santa Clara/Mojave Rivers Ranger District, but we administer the trail since it is logistically easier for us to access. (same as Buckhorn Campground)<br/>

Good job Jon!  <br/>
I think I will make a copy of that and carry it with my Forest Pass, just in case I get crazy again any time soon :-P<br/>
Once upon a time, that area was under the jurisdiction of the Valyermo Ranger District - but then that "District" was absorbed into what is now the Santa Clara/Mojave Rivers District which is located (or was) in the Valencia/Santa Clarita area.<br/>
Now, what I do know - for a fact - is that they are building a large facility on Sierra Hwy. (Historic Route 6) across from where my LB is located . . . . but that still won't guarantee that the R/H will know what the L/H is doing!!<br/>
 <br/>
AS for the clue - my nonlinear self says it doesn't say align yourself, just to face them ???  :-P<br/>
But I'm sure the boys are right, it's buried under 2 feet of loose rocks now - and it does say something about being in a "plastic bag" - I know it takes awhile, but those things do eventually start to break down ???<br/>
 <br/>
BTW - Kudos to your wife for making it all the way to the top carrying that beautiful child!  You too, for that matter!  WOW <br/>

It said that the BOX is IN the bag.  And if you look at the old photo, that smaller sage bush isn't even there, but Clarinet checked it anyhow.  Believe me, we were looking in the right place, but if the box is there, it's buried.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Passport To The Falls box, I followed the majority of the clues just fine, but couldn't work out the tree at the end of the clue.  So if somebody wants to give it a shot, maybe you can figure it out.  I didn't see much fire damage, so the if the box is still there, it should be fine, barring probable water damage.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, did any of you see What What's post on AQ?  She was stamping into the Faye Wray box at Hollywood Forever cemetery when the groundskeepers came and chopped down the tree the box was in!  Now she has a homeless box, but it's amazing luck she was there so that the box was saved!<br/>

&gt; AS for the clue - my nonlinear self says it doesn't say align yourself, just to <br/>
&gt;face them ???Â  :-P<br/>
&gt; But I'm sure the boys are right, it's buried under 2 feet of loose rocks now - <br/>
&gt;and it does say something about being in a "plastic bag" - I know it takes <br/>
&gt;awhile, but those things do eventually start to break down ???<br/>
<br/>
It said that the BOX is IN the bag.  And if you look at the old photo, that <br/>
smaller sage bush isn't even there, but Clarinet checked it anyhow.  Believe me, <br/>
we were looking in the right place, but if the box is there, it's buried.<br/>

Yeah, we were definately in the right bush. The box is probably still there, but deeply buried. Thats my optomism!<br/>
