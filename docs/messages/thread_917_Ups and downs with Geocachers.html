                    <div class="plaintext-content">For anyone who's looked at my "Alliteration" clue, you'll need to check it out again later.  I've removed what was left of it and will be placing it somewhere new and updating the clues.  Why?  Proximity to a geocache (and, quite honestly, to a homeless guy, too).<br>
<br>
Here's some samples from the geocache find log:<br>
<br>
"I initially found this one back in March but the log said that this was a letterbox and not the actual cache. I checked the logs and saw people finding it again, so I went back again yesterday but could not find anything other than the supposedly stupid letterbox. I knew then that this indeed was the cache I've been looking for. Was really mad thinking that someone might have written this on the log to send me and other geocachers on a wild goose chase."<br>
<br>
Yeah, that's why I wrote it....<br>
<br>
"Cachers who found this after me have concluded this is the cache and the note in the picture is a hoax placed there by some jokester."<br>
<br>
and the picture he posted:<br>
http://img.geocaching.com/cache/log/24f6d905-d0e6-4818-94b0-f353e71f1225.jpg<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, I have two stories to report on cool Geocachers.  Here is an email I received last month:<br>
<br>
"I am writing you today to express my sincere apologies for disrupting your letterbox cache. My family and I were hunting down a geocache in this park and came across - what we thought - was the cache. We signed the log and took the stamp as a FTF prize.<br>
<br>
Then two days ago, I rec'd an email from a geocacher accusing us of NOT finding the cache in the park. He said the log was not signed by us. I emailed the cache owner and we did some research to discover that we found the LETTERBOX  - INSTEAD of the geocache.<br>
<br>
So, please accept my sincerest apologies for taking your stamp. I can mail it back to you if you would like."<br>
<br>
Also, last year the stamp from my "Rose Hills" box was taken by a cacher (they left me a cigarette lighter) so I carved a replacement.  When I went to check on the box last week, I was surprised to find they had returned my stamp, so now the box has two versions of the image.  Bonus!<br>
