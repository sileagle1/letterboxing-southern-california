<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=2173<br>
<br>
So...wondering I can get some help with the carvings?<br>
I'd really like this to be a memorial/rememberance from our SoCal group relating to 9/11/01...what we went through, where we've come since then, honoring different aspects relating to this theme.<br>
<br>
If you'd like to carve a stamp for the event, would you let me know? I can either give you my address to mail it to me to plant, or set up a meeting day/time to pick them up from you.<br>
I'm in the stage of scouting a place to use,etc.<br>
<br>
I think with our nice group of letterboxers...talents, creativeness, thoughful & generous natures, etc....this could be a really nice way to remember/honor this decade-ago event.<br>
<br>
Thanks...Kim (aka***Cherry on Top***) <br>

Hi Cherry (and 9/11 gang),<br>
<br>
Our attendance this weekend (Outdoor Adventurer and Skater Chick) is a bit "iffy" because my hubby, a n'oxer I like to call Water Loss Guy, came home sick, from work, today.  My plan had been for him to camp this weekend with Little Puppy and his Boy Scout troop, but if he's still sick by then... We girls might be taking Little Puppy to camp this weekend, instead.  I'll let you know as soon as WE know what's happening. Thanks for putting this gathering together.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Outdoor Adventurer<br>
