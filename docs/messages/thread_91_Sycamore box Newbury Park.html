<br/>
Any one been to the Sycamore box in Newbury Park. Jelly and I are <br/>
planning on meeting some new leterboxers up in that area Sunday and <br/>
we want to make sure that they have a good time! We are going to <br/>
plant a box with them in that area.<br/>
Any help would be appreciated,<br/>

Where the heck have you two been? Seems like it's been six months <br/>
since y'all have planted a box, though I do come across your stamp <br/>
images from time to time.  I suppose you have an actual life; you <br/>
know, the sort of thing that really interferes with one's <br/>
letterboxing responsibilities. Fortunately, I've managed to avoid <br/>
having an actual life, and have placed 15 boxes this year.<br/>
--Buzzard  ;-)<br/>
