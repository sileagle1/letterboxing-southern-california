Saw no ranger station (where we were supposed to meet the Troop) anywhere, so drove and drove -- up Hwy. 39/San Gabriel Canyon, over on East Fork, and on to Glendora Mountain Road.  Spotty phone reception mostly prevented us from communicating with one another so... by the time we learned where the ranger station was (back the way we came) and found it, we arrived 2 hours past the meeting time, and the troop was gone.  Certainly can't blame them.<br/>
<br/>
Now, though I like to hike, I'm still a hiking novice, and knew it wasn't wise for me to attempt the Bridge to Nowhere hike, which is double the length of my so-far hikes, alone with my 11-year-old...<br/>
<br/>
So we made a couple of stops on the way home, and returned the trekking poles we'd rented, and came home.<br/>
<br/>
On the positive side, I did get to go to and see Azusa Canyon for the first time in over 30 years, AND didn't have to kill myself hiking 10 miles, slipping into the river while crossing, etc.  AND we get to go to the beach today as a whole family, with the kids' youth group.  <br/>
<br/>
So... lessons learned, beautiful scenery seen, over-strenuous hike skipped, and a day at the beach (with my HUBBY driving!).  Kind of win-win, in my book.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there's still the matter of a 10-mile hike being a Boy Scout requirement, so we'll have to face that sometime...<br/>
<br/>
... and if Kelsung had actually told me the name of the two letterboxes in the area that he'd adopted (I checked both AQ and LBNA)... but then again... I only had 3-1/2 hours of sleep last night, so really had no business letterboxing up there once I'd received a reprieve from the hike.<br/>
<br/>
I prayed for safety... next time I should pray for navigational grace too, I think. (smile)<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day, everyone.  I'm going to the beach.<br/>

 My kid is in Ice Canyon and doing the 3 T's (Timber, Telegraph and Thunder) and from here, the weather looks like it is going to be good for them.  This is a training hike for the 50 miles they are doing through the Sierra's at the end of this month.<br/>
But, back to the Bridge to Nowhere - I know I will not be ready to go that far anytime soon, but am hoping to be able to by the end of November??  If the weather holds, would anybody be up to that hike?  I was watching a "Youtube" video of a family that hiked it last December, actually 2 days after Christmas - seemed really neat.<br/>
We would, of course, have to plant two or three LB's along the way???<br/>
