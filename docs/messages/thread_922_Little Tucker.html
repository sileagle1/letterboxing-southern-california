<br/>
What a wonderful surprise we all had when your amazing gift arrived on board ship!  How ever did you do that?   Thank you soooo much!!!  We shared the huge bottle with fellow boxers on a 4 hr van ride to the interior of an island we visited.  Had hoped to see bears up close but only saw 4 far away.  It was a lovely and fun day though.<br/>
<br/>
I am going back to Kernville this Sat. or Sun. and would like to stop by your place with a little gift...since you were unable to come with us.  Can you send me your address asap?   My son has transfered all my data to my new computer but I cannot find my way around it so I snuck back to the older computer which he told me not to use....but dang it if he is not here helping me I'm not going to just sit it out without taking some action.<br/>
<br/>
I will be changing my email address when I can figure out how to.    <br/>
<br/>
Since I don't know which day I will be heading your way, I will leave package at your door or at a place you designate.....Love, Gwen<br/>
<br/>

With that said - <br/>
Gwen, I found a box here in Mammoth.  It was planted in 2004.  Unfortunately, and sad to say - the stamp was traded out for a yellow plastic smiley face.  I removed what was left of the log book - which has the orginal image on it - and will bring it to you.  Left the important info along with a note from me stating it was a LB and what had happened - maybe we can get it replaced??<br/>
Okay - well hello everybody!!<br/>
Now that you all know where I am and what I'm doing - next time I'll wear my glasses when I respond to an e-mail  :-P<br/>

Miss Gwen,as much as I would absolutely love to see you - I am not at home :-{  We came up to Mammoth to drop my son off for his 50 mile hike through the Sierra's and down into Yosemite.  We will be going to Lee Vining from here and then up into Tuolomne Meadows to rendezvous with the hikers and give them their food and supplies.  I'll be home on the 27th.  When are you heading back to the beach??  Or, how long will you be in Kernville??I am so glad you guys enjoyed the champagne - and I'm glad you got it!  I felt dumb asking Grumpy but when I got the receipt, it had somebody elses name on it!! <br/>
So, hope to see you soon - OH, didn't really get to see Wassa and the gang but for a second.  Hubby had sold a truck to a guy in West Hollywood and we delivered it to him - which ended up taking a lot longer than anticipated, then Hubby was hungry and then we had to pick the kid up in San Pedro coming home from a week in Catalina.  Well we gotta go and see if we can find our camping spot!OH, by the way - saw three bears just last night!Love ya - Kim<br/>
