<br>
... so I'm looking up letterboxes in Pasadena...<br>
<br>
But I didn't find one listed that I remember was recently planted -- at a house (Millard House?) designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.<br>
<br>
I've looked on both AQ and LBNA.  Can anybody help me find the clues?<br>

Thanks,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Piper Paws ~ that's just the one! (of course, I'll only be looking for Box #4).  I've written to Lost Sailor (the planter), to find out if there's anything special I should bring with me in order to get a clear stamp impression.  This was inspired by Kelsung's comment about the boxes:<br>
<br>
"Not so much a stamping as a rubbing. I used a pen, an ink pad case, my iPhone and a size D battery. The battery worked the best."<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks again!<br>
