<br/>
well as some of you may know from my gaff of a few days ago, I have been in the Eastern Sierra's doing the tourist thing as well as being a "trail angel" for starving Boy Scout hikers coming down from Donahue Pass into Tuolomne Meadows - <br/>
<br/>
While there, I had the opportunity to do some Letterboxing - but had to be selective in what I did as to not drive the hubby into refusing to drive me to the different locations, so decided on Don and Gwen's series "Hwy 395 Enigmas,Opposites,and Illusions"<br/>
<br/>
I chose these particular boxes because #1, they fit into our "tourist" plans and #2 becausethey were planted in 2004 and no one had found the majority of them in almost three years!!<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to report that we found all six of them, and all are alive and well with the exception of Number 1. <br/>
That one has unfortunately been "traded" for a yellow plastic smiley face and a bit of obsidian :-(<br/>
However, I was able to recover the portion of the logbook that had the originalimage on it, so am hoping maybe we can replace the stamp at some point in the near future??<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, the box itself is still there and I just stamped an index card with my stamp and stuck it in there just to keep it alive. You should do the same :-)<br/>
If you are going to be in the area for a day, or two, I suggest you go for this series - however, if you do, remember that in seven years lots can change and things may not always be as they seem.<br/>
<br/>
If we hadn't done the Great Buckhorn Expedition, I never would have taken this bunch on, but am sure glad I did.<br/>
Classic Don and Gwen scenery and interesting info.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Kelsung :-)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you are all having wonderful adventures this Summer and are keeping cool - Dezert Ratty <br/>
