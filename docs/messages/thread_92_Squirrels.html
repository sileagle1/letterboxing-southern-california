You think it was tough to find, when Gwen &amp; I finally found Squirrels Botanical Box it was in zip loks. We put it in a container. I'm fairly sure the Bonnelli box has been gone for some time. Hope  your leg heals quick.<br/>

  Well that really chaps my hide.  It was one of the first stamps I <br/>
  ever looked for, so maybe I can blame missing it on inexperience. I <br/>
  also spent that day looking for another Squirrel box planted in Frank <br/>
  G. Bonnelli Park, also without success.  <br/>
