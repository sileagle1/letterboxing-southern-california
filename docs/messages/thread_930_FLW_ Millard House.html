Yeah, I think Lost Sailor is going to need to add a disclaimer for the Pasadena house, "Not for GIRL arms or other short-limbed people," lol.  Kind of like One of Earl Grey's Pocket Monster boxes "bring a tall or agile friend" -- fortunately for that one, my shorter-than-me companion is younger and more agile than I.  I would never have attempted what she did, to reach the box.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to Kelsung's bonus box tips, as I only have 2 more days in Pasadena! <br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

&gt; I think you and I were in the right place with the wrong arms. 8^)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was second finder of the bonus box after you-know-who.<br/>
&gt; It helped that I had once planned to plant a box there, and had scoured the property thoroughly trying to find a good spot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have you done the other boxes in the series? They're a little further for you, but definitely worth it! And they only require normal length arms...  = P<br/>

&gt; &gt; So my theory is correct!  Assuming your arm is longer than mine, that is... I had my full arm in there, and couldn't find it.  Had my son try first, since a kid digging around would raise no suspicions, but since my arm is longer than his...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Any chance you moved it slightly forward, when you returned it to the shelf?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh, and have you found the Bonus Box?  I tried that twice, but couldn't find the line of bricks... surely not downhill, into the "stay out - uneven ground" portion of the property?<br/>

You would need to find a box with a bonus clue in it in order to find the bonus box.  Otherwise, I don't know how you'd know where to look.  And it would be inappropriate for me to give hints on how to interpret someone else's clues.<br/>
