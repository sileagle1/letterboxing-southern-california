                    <div class="plaintext-content">So last night I can't sleep, as usual, and I decide to clear up some work on my computer - finally get pooped out and turned off all the lights in my "office". <br>
I grabbed the telephone in one hand and my glass of water in the other and headed through the dark to the light switch on the landing.<br>
It's not that far and even though it was pitch dark I was going along pretty good - ran smack into my black dog, who had decided to lay directly in the middle of everythingand flew about a two feet up in the air and came smack down on both knee caps.<br>
Now, if I was a gazelle that might not have been an issue, but being an out of shape overweight getting older woman - OUCH!! OUCH!! <br>
Good news is - I did not land on the dog and only spilled a few drops of water - go figure.<br>
My husband wakes up and wants to know what I am doing on all fours in the dark - the dog wakes up and scurries off with it's ears burning from the littany of curses being flung at it . . . . I have rug burns on both knees and I can't get up - AND that's not the weird part . . . . . <br>
After finally getting up and realizing I didn't break anything ( I hope) and getting to sleep - I start to dream.<br>
I dreamed that some new Letterboxers out my way (who do actually exist) misunderstood how Letterboxing works and had "adopted" each of my plants by moving them and then re-listing them as their own??<br>
It was a really weird dream, that got into more detail than I remember - but what in thee heck? <br>
All that from tripping over a dog and damn near killing myself :-o<br>
I was thinking it meant I had repressed anxiety over being too busy to box or check up on my boxes??<br>
<br>
FYI - Found a package of 4 Lock&Lock's at Ross for $5.49. They are 0.3QT (350ml/11oz). I normally pay $2.50 each, and have to buy6 or so for that price -plus shipping, so thought this was a pretty good deal.<br>
<br>
Hope everyone is well and having a great summer - sweet dreams<br>

Yikes...hope you're feeling ok. Dogs are sneaky critters.<br>
Your dream cracked me up....I had a LB dream couple weeks ago.<br>
Someone started stealing all the LBs in SoCal & taking them to other countries, but still listing them under the carver's name...like the LBs were going on vacations!<br>

Well, here's hoping your knees bounce back none the worse for wear. You'll need them, because those real new letterboxers have given you a lot of new plants to go after out there. I this makes the second weekend I've put them off, but I know I'll be making another trip to the desert soon. They've made it too irresistible.<br>

Ouch! hope you feel better soon. I had that problem with my dear dobie, he blended in so well with the carpet at night! I finally  learned to do a kind of puppy-shuffle...Talking to warn him I was coming never helped, of course.<br>

You poor thing, Dezert Ratty... hey, I've lost 14 lbs... what was the plan? A new letterbox for every ten pounds lost? I did have letterboxing dreams last week, but not strange ones. At least, I can't remember them. Praying for your knees to feel better soon....<br>

Oh, yeah, I've had letterboxing dreams. Once I was in some weird space like one of those 3-D chess sets, going from level to level looking for boxes...<br>
