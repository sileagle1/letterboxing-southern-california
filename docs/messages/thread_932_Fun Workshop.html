Carving rubber stamps is such a wonderful artform, and of course they can be used for more than letterboxing (though LBing is the highest use of the artform ;).<br/>
<br/>
This Sunday (sorry for the late notice, but this workshop will be offered again next year) I'm teaching a workshop in Torrance that will include stamping on fabric and also a simple paper applique on fabric.  The finished project is a zippered canvas pouch (no sewing required).<br/>
<br/>
If you are at all interested please go to my blog/website, workshopsatwendyshouse.blogspot.com or email me at ilovetocarve@gmail.com<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see some of you Sunday.<br/>
