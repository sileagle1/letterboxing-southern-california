<br>
So I'm wondering if anyone else has had any trouble with the mini ink pads, acid-free dye-based, by Rubber Stampede? The multi-color set is new. The colored image looks spotty...like there isn't a consistent level of ink holding on the stamp. <br>
<br>
What brand so you like best for mini inks? And where have you found them? I need individual ones, not a stack of inks.<br>
<br>
Thanks boxers :)<br>
