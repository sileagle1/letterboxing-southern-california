Tender Greens in culver city is good, though a little on the pricey side, and sometimes pretty crowded so might not be good if a bunch of people end up coming.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, considering how last minute it was put together, we had a decent group come meet oj drinker, the only boxer I've met who's found a Mapsurfer letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing a much bigger group camping in Sylmar.  MrOspital and I were planning and planting Saturday, and along with Lee, we should have over 40 boxes for the event, including a couple night boxes for campers.<br/>
