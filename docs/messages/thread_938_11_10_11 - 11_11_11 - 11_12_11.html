Thanks to everyone who contributed their time and talents, and most of all to MrOspital for planning and carrying out the mission with creativity, practicality and patience. You know your event is successful when people huddled  under a rain shelter are already talking about doing ANOTHER camping event!  =-) <br/>

ahoy...what a great time seeing everyone again.  great plants and clues. loved the venue Occupy Sylmar. Mr. O's WOMs were fantastic. What can i say?  i got excited. The camping super fun. The dutch oven work by Dezert Ratty out of this world. Boxing with all you Socal people is always a blast.  Even the noxer hubby had fun.<br/>
hugs and kisses<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">mrrr, so sad I've been missing letterbox gatherings.. This one in particular, I love camping! and I really wanted to check out the carving class! And it would have been great to meet some of you guys a second time, and meet more of you for the first time! Alas, I had to work Friday, and I had friends from out of state visiting over the weekend. :( I hope there will be more gatherings in the works soon though, yes??<br/>
<br/>
also, i really need to check my ymail more often, i keep forgetting about this yahoo group..<br/>
