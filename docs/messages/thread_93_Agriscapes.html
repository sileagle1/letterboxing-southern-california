As you can imagine, not every SoCal letterboxer belongs to this <br>
group (or even knows about it), so they post clues elsewhere.  I <br>
always check the "What's New" link on the letterboxing.org Web site; <br>
that's where I spotted this new letterbox in Pomona.  Sierra Sally, <br>
the letterboxer who placed this box, wrote us that she's from the <br>
Central Coast, and just planted the box on a visit here.  <br>
Unfortunately, we were there too early to get into Agriscapes, <br>
seemed like an interesting place.<br>
