You are more than welcome.  <br>
Unfortunately High Dezert Hollywood: MacGyver- To Be a Man IS definitely not where it's supposed to be and Route 6 is not where it's supposed to be either - <br>
However, on an "up" note -  I finally got the "new" Abbey one that is 3.7 miles from my house and on the same road I live on!!!  woo hoo<br>

You mean it doesn't end in Bishop, anymore?  We were just up there last year, and the highway looked to be in good shape.  Or were you referring to the fact that it doesn't go all the way into Long Beach, anymore?  Not like that sort of thing doesn't happen a lot; some of us wish that the 101 still went all the way to San Diego, and that CA 1 still ran through Petrolia and the Lost Coast area.<br>
<br>
Of course, quite a lot of the old Route 6 pavement still exists, as much as 95% of it, I would guess.  With only a few small re-routes, there is nothing missing between Bishop and Mojave, and only a couple of miles is gone between Mojave and Rosamond, due to the bridge-connector over the RR tracks.  Sierra Highway still runs about where it always has, and most of the Route's tracing through the LA Basin still exists.  I can't be certain, as I've never taken the time to dig that deep, but I suspect that I've driven just about every mile of US 6 (The Grand Army of the Republic Highway) in California.  Quite an interesting road, in some ways much more scenic and historic than Route 66 ever was, at least in California.<br>
<br>
Of course, it wouldn't surprise me if CalTrans has mis-marked some of the old highway, i.e. put up "Historic Route 6" signs on the wrong road.  Sacramento has been showing signs of dysfunction at least since the days of Pete Wilson, so if there are signs on the wrong road, well, it just fits a pattern that has manifested itself for decades.  I'll have to look for them the next time I'm out that way.  The only ones that I can be certain that I've seen are one on the 14 freeway, south of Palmdale, and one on Sierra Highway in the Saugus/Newhall area.  I also know that I've seen one or two north of Inyokern, but I can't recall where.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for the memory jostle :-)<br>

I completely missed it when I went looking to see if you had an LB with something like that name.  I must have mistyped something, or was just blind.  I *do* need to see my optometrist; time to get my prescription checked, anyway :-p<br>
<br>
FWIW, there is a geocache on that same tank; it's been there since 2008.  We got it before your LB was hidden.  It's a bison tube: a small metal tube just big enough for a rolled-up piece of paper, so it shouldn't be confused for a letterbox.  It disappeared a couple of months ago, and has been replaced.  Wanna bet that someone found both things and removed them at the same time?  I suppose that someone has to do maintenance checks on that tank now and then, and maybe cleaning up of the area.  I hope this helps you when you replace your LB, which I hope to look for the next time I'm out that way, which is pretty often.<br>
