Well...I have relatively flat feet & I guess I lift my toes up when I walk. No problem when I usually wear flip flops, but in Dec. when I started wearing Ugg boots...the weight of the boot accelerated the condition & then I wore dressy flip flop sandals to go out a few times & the toe pushing toward my big toe to keep the shoe on has turned the toe sideways. So it's stretched away from the foot & sideways. hey when I break things...I do it BIG!! <br>
Hubby says I'm like a used car...little things gonna start falling apart :(<br>

I live one town over, but this weekend is spoken for, and evenings are already awkward enough in our household, with Sharon's work in upheaval and she in PT for a shoulder injury.  Might have been able to figure something out with a week's notice.  Too bad; it might have been fun.  Sorry :-(  <br>
