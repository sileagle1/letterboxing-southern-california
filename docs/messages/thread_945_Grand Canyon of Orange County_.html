<br>
My 50th birthday is coming up next month, and hubby wants to take me to hike (and presumably letterbox) a place I read about within the past 12 months, in letterbox clues.  I'm thinking it was in Irvine or Tustin... and surely at least one of you knows (and maybe even planted the box).  <br>
<br>
Does this ring a bell for anybody?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not sure about any boxes there, but the place you are thinking of is Limestone Canyon Wilderness Area -- specifically "The Sinks".  <br>
It was mentioned in the August 2011 Westways with a short blurb.<br>
 <br>
You can only go on certain "wilderness access days", which happen like once a month or maybe less.  <br>
You must sign up in advance.  These do fill up.<br>
http://www.irlandmarks.org/Explore/Limestone-Canyon-Wilderness-Area.aspx<br>
 <br>
The Westways article was a little misleading -- describing the new "shoestring trail" as a 3/4 mile hike, crossing two bridges and a boardwalk through rolling grassland and wooded oak.  They showed the photo above implying you will see this stunning vista after your 3/4 mile stroll.<br>
 <br>
The reality -- as we found one hot hot day in October with minimal advance research, and with two grumpy nap-resistant toddlers on our backs --  was a little different.  <br>
The Shoestring trail itself is mostly an extension of a paved access road, followed by a section along a busy road, and nary a oak was in sight.  <br>
The only reason the new trail is notable is that it connects some other oaky grassland trails together, allowing a 5 or 12 mile loop.<br>
 <br>
To actually get to "The Sinks" pictured in westways and the website, it is actually  ~8 mile roundtrip with about 800 ft elevation change.  <br>
Apparently they used to offer 2 mile docent led hikes and full moon hikes starting from Santiago staging area (see Afoot & Afield OC chapter 8, available for preview on google books) -- but I can't tell if they still do that one.  It seems you can see the Sinks or similar from a 5 mile hike starting from Portola in Whiting Ranch (perhaps every day.. also unclear).  The website is pretty useless, offering neither trailmaps nor hike descriptions specific to the Limestone area.  Perhaps a phone call might be more useful.<br>
 <br>
Our experience was obviously a little tainted, but we do plan to go back in the springtime (rather than end of summer) and actually head towards the canyon (rather than the shoestring trail).  From some various hiking blogs, the area looks quite lovely in the spring, and with proper preparation it would probably make for a good hike. <br>

Wow, Jon, so glad I asked!  Yes, I'm a Westways reader, so that's probably where I learned of Limestone Canyon Wilderness Area.  Maybe I thought to myself it might be a good place to plant... Thanks for the info and link... I'll look into it further.  I do have an "Afoot and Afield" book, but it's the L.A. County version... Which in my opinion gives insufficient data about hiking trails, but at least provides a starting place.<br>
<br>
Thanks again...<br>
