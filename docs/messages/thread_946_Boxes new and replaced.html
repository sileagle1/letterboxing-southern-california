When you plant a new one, people notice.  But if one went missing a while ago, people tend to forget or ignore the listing after a while, so I figured if I didn't hold up a big neon sign, most of you wouldn't notice, so that's why I'm posting this.  The following boxes have all been recently replaced:<br/>
<br/>
San Pedro Series (all three of these are now just small magnetic containers, but I HAD to replace them because I LOVE the locations and still want others to discover them.)<br/>
Penn &amp; Teller<br/>
Skyknight<br/>
X (for anyone who has solved my PT)<br/>
Sound Guy (actually a new box in a whole new location)<br/>
Rose Hills<br/>
Prism (along with Lee's Big Dogs #1)<br/>
$<br/>
Seeking Skinny (actually just moved another box)<br/>
Space Shuttle<br/>
Alliteration (also in a whole new location)<br/>
<br/>
Along the way, Dezert Ratty also confirmed that Duel was still in place.<br/>
<br/>
The only one left to replace is McDonald's History #2: Speedee, which I'll be getting back out soon.  Meanwhile, I finally planted #3: Golden Arches, along with new box Treasure Island, and I planted Juicy Fruit by I dig toasters to replace her Spearmint box.<br/>
<br/>
So what's next on my agenda?  I can't tell you, but I can give you a Klue....<br/>

&gt; But I heard a rumor that your Klue's are only for the new and not the old . . . . or are you capitulating to theMissouri mistress of chrome and crumbs and planning devious actions for the month of showers??????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Brilliant phrasing.  You should write box clues like that.  And I think she'd love that title.  But we've already discussed it and she won't be able to line up her schedule with my plans.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I'm thinking of doing it in LATE April, since I did events two years in a row that both had issues with rain.  And that rumor is half true.  I've stated a couple times that I intend to open it up to those who didn't play last year first.  Then after a couple weeks, I would give the game veterans a chance to fill any slots that might still be available.  It just seemed fair to give those who missed out last year a chance first.  I was actually genuinely shocked at how strong an interest I got, with the slots all filled within just a few hours.<br/>
