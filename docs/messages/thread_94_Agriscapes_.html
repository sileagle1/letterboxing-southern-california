By the by, we would love to meet and exchange with you and French Hen, too, <br>
when you are back on your feet--never did exchange in SLO, did we? We still <br>
need to get the last two in your Halloween series, too.<br>
<br>
Do you decorate as elaborately for the major holidays as you do for Halloween <br>
(minus the costume for scaring trick-or-treaters)?<br>

Yes, I decorate as elaborately for Christmas as well.  As I just <br>
wrote to Purple Iris, this Cal Poly Pomona LB was just placed on <br>
November 18, and I saw it in the "What's New" link of <br>
Letterboxing.org, which I check nearly every day.  If you haven't <br>
yet found the Rancho Santa Anita Botanical Garden's letterbox, we <br>
could meet Purple Iris out there for an exchange (she said she'd <br>
help me and the French Hen find it).  I am still on the mend though.<br>

Hi Buzzard,<br>
We ran across Doughtnut, et al at the gardens some time ago, but when <br>
ever you are ready and up on your feet, we could do a mini-meet. <br>
Anyone else like to join us? So let us know when you are ready. <br>

If you don't mind a crowd, the Rancho Santa Ana box is on our list to<br>
do...<br>
<br>
If you sign up for the yahoo group lbox-announce you can get an email<br>
