Mr. Ospital has posted an all day long "Carve In" so he can show us how to make fake rocks.  He's hosting it at his home in La Habra and providing materials.  The idea is we can start making them in the morning, and while the cement is drying, we can have an afternoon BBQ, then in the evening we should be able to paint them.  Some who were interested can't make it on March 31st, so he's thinking of switching it to maybe April 15th.  I wanted to help get the word out for him, so who's in?<br>
<br>
Finally, I've waited long enough and have made a hasty decision on my location (which of course, I'm not yet revealing) so Kelsung Klue is here again.  As I've mentioned, I wanted to give people who didn't get to play last time a chance to sign up first, then open any empty slots up to those who played last year.  It will be on the last Saturday in April.  Who's in?  (Well, you'll have to wait a few weeks to actually sign up...)<br>

Ren Fair is in Irwindale now at the Santa Fe Dam- Mr. Ospital has a SUPER<br>
EASY letter box hidden there- just ask Kelsung how easy it is to find.....<br>
Don't know if we will be going this year, having a hard time fitting into<br>
my costume these days!<br>

into my yahoo account for the first time since december to see about 50<br>
email alerts from this groups message board. I should probably change my<br>
settings so I get messages from here at my main email account...<br>
Too bad I missed out on Griffith Park :( but I am going to try and make<br>
it to upcoming events, though probably won't make the downtown LA thing.<br>
Also I somehow convinced my roommate to try out letterboxing, and she<br>
had her first find last weekend! And of course I'll be dragging her with<br>
me to events too.. Her trailname is DoseyDoe<br>
<http://www.atlasquest.com/people/profile.html?gMemberId=61593>  (links<br>
to AQ profile) and I think we're gonna be letterboxing out around<br>
Griffith park sometime late tomorrow (today? saturday) morning if anyone<br>
else happens to be around there. :)<br>

I think if you had one that I just needed to walk up to you and ask for, that would be cool, but I'd also want at least one that required me to actually follow some clues around the Faire to find it.<br>
