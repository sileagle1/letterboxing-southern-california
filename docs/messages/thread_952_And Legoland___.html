<br/>
I'm taking the kids to Legoland this weekend, going to do the park on saturday, thinking of picking up some boxes sunday on our way back to Colton.  Any recommended boxes?  So far, I'm looking at Clues in Coronado (because then I have an excuse to go see the Del), but other than that, I am totally clueless.  Get it?  Clueless?  Bwaaaa haaaa haaaa ha ha ha...  Oh.  Sorry.  <br/>
<br/>
I dig that box radar, it's really easy to pull up the clues in an area you're not familiar with.  Sigh.  I promise, I'm looking at everything on LBNA and AQ, but I don't have a lot of time, and my printer is broken, so I have to write everything down.  <br/>

Love, Beach Celt<br/>
