 trying to get prepared for IDT's arrival and our attempt to find some LB's and was wondering if anybody happens to know if the boxes in Irvine Regional Park can still be found with the original Letterbox Roundup Clue handout???<br>
<br>
Also, with limited time are there any in the Irvine, Tustin, Orange area that just can't be missed???<br>

A LOT of them are missing, so check the status and finds, but enough are their to make the trip well worth it. The clues should still work.<br>
