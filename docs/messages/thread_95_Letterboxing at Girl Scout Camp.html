This looks great! Thanks for the nice photos of your event and <br>
especially the stamps--they're very nicely carved. I hope some of <br>
these 50 start planting boxes around SoCal, 'cos we're always in need <br>
of new boxes.  Letterboxing in SoCal hasn't yet reached the flash <br>
point, but I think it is coming.<br>
