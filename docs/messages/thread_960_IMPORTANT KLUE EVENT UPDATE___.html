<br/>

<br/>
I'm freaking out right now! I just got some frustrating information.<br/>
<br/>
So, forget about the secrecy, the event is going to be at Schabarum Regional Park in Hacienda Heights. I've worked out the trails, planned all the box locations and written all the clues. This has to be where it will happen.<br/>
<br/>
However.... Back on March 18th the park was supposed to have their annual Cherry Blossom Festival, but it rained. They postponed it for a week...so I thought. Turns out they rescheduled it for, you guessed it, April 28th.<br/>
<br/>
The place will be packed. I probably won't be able to get the group of tables I'm planning to use, and all the extra muggle eyes makes me fear for the boxes. Not just during the game, but the planting beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
I have to move the game to another day. The easiest is just the next day, Sunday the 29th. I really really really really hope all of you have the day available AND get this message. If everyone would please respond to this as soon as possible. I can't wait a week, because Saturday May 5th I have an all day gig in Huntington Beach. Please please respond. I'm so annoyed and depressed right now.<br/>
