The last time I stayed down that way - geez was it really only two weeks ago??  I went on Priceline and got a hotel in Placentia for $64.00 bucks which included FREE wi-fi, FREE breakfast and (this one always cracks IDT up) FREE Parking!!!  I bid $50/night and the rest was all the Tax they charge you.  It was pretty decent.   And, get this, the room we stayed in was usually 109.00 plus tax - which I am way to cheap too ever pay :-P <br>
Before you bid, use the search engine to pull up the hotels in the area and what "star" rating they have, that way you know what rating to "bid" on.<br>
And, just so you know - your room at the ratz nest is ready an waiting . . . . . <br>
