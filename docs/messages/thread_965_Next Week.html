1.  Ratty... How far??? The clues say "4 miles if you just letterbox; longer if you do the entire loop" -- but it doesn't say how much longer.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Kelsung... hmmm... Malibu Canyon during Rattlesnake Season... It will be a longshot, but I'll ask my hubby, Water Loss Guy.  It would be nice for you two to be able to meet, at last -- he came to Klue 2, later in the day, but it wasn't a good opportunity to introduce you.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Sounds like fun -- happy birthday!!!<br/>
