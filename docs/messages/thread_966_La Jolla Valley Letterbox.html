The "Click on the button to get the Key to translate the clues." and the "Click on the button to see the clues." don't work for me (i.e., nothing happens). <br>

I know, Kelsung has already cracked the code for us (and I probably don't have time - or talent - to crack it, myself), but I was curious and hoped to at least SEE it.<br>

They are pop-up windows. Check to see if your browser options are set to prevent pop-ups. It's a simple and fun code.<br>
<br>
Ratty, the first mile has a lot of up and some rock climbing beside a creek bed, but the second mile is pretty level and easy.<br>
<br>
The long loop would also get you the Mugu Peak and Chumash Elevator, but not this trip.<br>
<br>
I'm rethinking that Sunday would be better. Might be BBQing at the in-laws Monday.<br>

KEY:   http://homepage.mac.com/advtrvlr/LaJolla/cluekey.gif<br>
<br>
An 800 foot elevation gain, sounds challenging, but doable.<br>
I was also leaning toward Monday as the better day, although temperature-wise Saturday would be the coolest.  This reminds me of the Great Buckhorn Expedition (Did you carve an event stamp?), only doing the uphill hiking at the start, while you still have some energy.<br>

Shoot, Alarch... Not sure who all went, but they moved it to today (and so we were unable to participate). I'm assuming it happened -- would love to find a date to reschedule, if it didn't happen, after all.<br>

Thanks, I thought maybe that was the case, but the thread kind of dropped off so I wasn't sure. That's what I get for not checking my email sooner,   =-)<br>
I'd go for the re-schedule as well.<br>
Hope everybody has a great holiday!<br>

Hope everybody has a great holiday!<br>
