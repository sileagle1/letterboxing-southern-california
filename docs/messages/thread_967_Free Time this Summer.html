                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, my son's Summer Football begins June 4th and runs through July 13th - they practice twice a day and we live too far away to make it practical, or cost effective to drive 8 R/T's a day during this time - so the parents of one of his Football buddies has offered to keep him a few days a week to help defray the cost - which means I will actually have some free time one or two days a week - WOO HOO!!!<br>
<br>
Anybody want to box?? Preferably somewhere cooler than the Dezert???<br>
