We did two Long hikes on Sunday.  The first up the mountain and back was hard to find because the clues we off a little.  The second (a series of 5, with 4 missing) was down a mountain and back then uphill, reminiscent of the buckhorn expedition.  I did not help that Kelsung's daughter and freind would run up the mountain ahead of us, and then wait as we huffed and puffed, slowly climbing the ascent.<br/>
<br/>
All in all it was a lot of fun, and wished more could have made it; but it was all rather last minute.  That's probably why there was no event stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Just giving Kelsung a hard time.  Again, happy birthday.<br/>

Trust me, Lee, if I could have gone on Sunday, there would have been an event stamp, as I had plans to make one! Glad you guys had a good time, amidst the huffing and puffing.<br/>

I still have fond memories of the Buckhorn Expedition and the miraculous appearance of the Quest Mobile driving down a closed road behind a locked USFS gate . . . <br/>
what a save :-)<br/>
 <br/>
I was hoping to have some days to "myself" this summer to go boxing, but was just informed, last night, that I will be babysitting my MIL for pretty much the whole month of July . .  so bummed - the things we do for our spouses and loved ones <br/>

&gt; Thanks to all and sorry I disappeared!  Long weekend!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I spent Thursday and Friday putting out some new plants, all day Saturday doing sound for 15 bands, Sunday I did TWO hikes with my daughter, a friend of hers and Lee, then spent Monday at my brother-in-law's with board games and BBQ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm tired....<br/>
