Let there be no wondering: it's in great shape, high in the hills north of Claremont.  I was out that way hiking with a friend, and I had the clues for this along with me.

It was quite warm, so we didn't do nearly as much hiking as we had planned.  This area will be very hot and dry for the next three months, so extra caution is required.  Heed any red-flag notices.  Bring extra water.  Consider going out very early in the morning, or late in the afternoon.  But if you have been putting off going after this because you weren't sure if it was there, you can put those worries aside :-)<br/>

Glad to hear it's still there! Moderndulcinea sure did know how to write clues. = )  <br/>
It's been a few years, but I seem to remember that hike being hilly  in places too.<br/>

Please let me know when you do go on this Away Mission. Perhaps I or we can be a part of your Away Team.  We had to abandon our quest for this a couple of April's ago because a couple of "venomous drones" wanted to assimilate us.  Would love to try again DURING their regeneration cycle. (November-March?) Much safer that way.<br/>

Early November sounds prime to me - I would rather be beamed to the location, but will more than likely pilot the shuttle-craft "Questmobile" to the mission site - <br/>
