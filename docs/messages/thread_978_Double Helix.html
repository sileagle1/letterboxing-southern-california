Does anyone happen to have an impression of my double Double Helix stamp? <br>
I was finally going to get around to recarving it this week... but somehow I can't find any images of it. <br>
I never throw away the test stamps and tracing paper, yet those seem to have gone missing, likely swept away in some spring cleaning madness. Also, the logbook from 2009 seems to be gone as well.<br>
If anyone can scan in the stamp and email it to me -- or even just a photo would be great.<br>
thanks!<br>
