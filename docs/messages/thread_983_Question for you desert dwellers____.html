I'm pretty sure both Lakes are fenced and/or "privately owned" in the Lake Hughes area??  <br>

So many options... <br>
I worry about big pines filling up, given we are getting there Saturday with no reservation?<br>
I'll check out paradise.<br>
<br>
 I'm now considering ojai -- rose valley or middle lion, with wheeler gorge as backup.  <br>
 I'm also thinking crystal lake/coldbrook.<br>

What a coincidence!  I was just at Rose Valley today getting the (badly damaged) box at the waterfall.  The campground was completely full, but I drove past a handful of others on the way in and out.  Busy, but probably some vacancies.<br>
<br>
If you do happen to check out the Mountain Flower box (quick hike, cool waterfall) bring along a new container and bags for the poor thing.  I didn't have anything with me (shame on me, I'm usually prepared, but this trip was a whim).<br>
