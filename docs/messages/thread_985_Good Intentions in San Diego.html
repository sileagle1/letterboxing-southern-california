Hello,<br>
<br>
Our girl scout troop is currently working on our Silver Award project. To complete this project we are restoring letterboxes in the San Diego community.  We recently searched for the Jack Murphy letterbox. We are please to inform you that so far we have searched for 9 letterboxes all over San Diego and yours was the only we found. that being said, however, we did restore it by adding an ink pad, pen, and paper.  We hope our efforts help you and our community  become a nicer place. We cannot update our findings on the website but hope that you will use this information to update the webpage. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Troop 3277<br>

 There is a girl scouting board on AQ. It might be helpful to mention this there.  They did include their troop number, and maybe one of the letterboxers who is involved with scouting can send their troop leader some helpful tips.  <br>
Publications that print articles about boxing often say that pens and inkpads are standard equipment in boxes  and fail to mention the all-important baggies.  = )<br>
