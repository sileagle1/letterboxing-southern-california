                    <div class="plaintext-content">I swear, I'll never beat Kelsung!  Was out for breakfast Sunday before last, and my breakfast companion pulled up box radar on his phone.  Found a new one close to me, but his connection sucked, so we rushed back here to pull it up on my computer.  New box yes, but planted mid July.  Picked it up anyhow, and of course, there was Kelsung, lol...  <br/>
<br/>
On a related note, we could use more boxes in Corona/Norco, if anyone is up to it.  The kids had a great time finding the Norco boxes, we'd go out to Ren Faire early friday, get things set up, then go boxing and out to dinner (highly recommend Norco Big Boy, totally old school!).  But sigh, we're out of nearby boxes out there...<br/>
<br/>
I'd say I could use more in Redlands too, but there are so many out this way, I need to not be lazy and just drive a few miles.  Perhaps this weekend!!!<br/>
