Was that a choice of two?  <br>
<br>
This was fun:<br>
http://www.flashfilmworks.com/d-holes.htm<br>
(I found a usable image elsewhere).<br>
<br>
And Vidalia Onions???  I fail to see the connection between onions and movies filmed in the High Dezert... but I found a nice image.<br>
Before I assign it to S.C. to carve, I should make sure I'm understanding that this is just onions we're talking about... and not some reference (Like "worms" = "How to eat fried worms" -- the movie.).<br>
<br>
So ambitious... gonna get those High Dezert Hikes in, aren't you?  Good for you!<br>
<br>

<br>
This was fun:<br>
http://www.flashfilmworks.com/d-holes.htm<br>
(I found a usable image elsewhere).<br>
<br>
And Vidalia Onions???  I fail to see the connection between onions and movies filmed in the High Dezert... but I found a nice image.<br>
Before I assign it to S.C. to carve, I should make sure I'm understanding that this is just onions we're talking about... and not some reference (Like "worms" = "How to eat fried worms" -- the movie.).<br>
<br>
So ambitious... gonna get those High Dezert Hikes in, aren't you?  Good for you!<br>
<br>
O.A.<br>
