In my experience, it is mostly the Ratty ones found creeping around dezerts, which are partial to Buck!!!  Now that time has passed, I can say, the box in all its awesomeness was worth the adventure, and a back way might have removed some of the story telling aspect of the find!  Did you have Buck with you when Kelsung took us night boxing in that park?!!! Remember when that guy at Wendy's was coming from behind you?? Oh what fun tales we have to tell. :-)     <br/>

I also know that toasters are not impervious to torrential downpours and will do almost anything just to have a bowl of alphabet soup - even if that means staying in an old lima bean factory :-P<br/>
