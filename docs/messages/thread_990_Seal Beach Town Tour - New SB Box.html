Arrowhead Landmark Monument<br>
By Chowder   found July 19, 2003 <br>
(actually I found it a couple weeks earlier, but had to wait for my signature stamp that I ordered online)<br>
Box later burned up in a fire.<br>
<br>
I like the way the clue starts: "Inland Empire Series...", means boxes closer to me. <br>

Yes, and I think you'd agree the location deserved a new box.  It's funny, my first find was the Marina Paicifica Plumbing Problem, also a Chowder box.<br>
<br>
Now that you got me looking back through Chowder's boxes again, I notice that "Rock Camp" is not said to be missing, but I don't see it on LbNA, even in the basement.  I think I have a new forgotten box to confirm or deny the existence of.<br>

<br>
Yep, and I already planted one in Riverside, too.  I should soon have two in Upland, and maybe one in Redlands.  You already got the first four.<br>

A lazy Sunday lunch in Riverside sounds like a great way to spend my afternoon...<br>
