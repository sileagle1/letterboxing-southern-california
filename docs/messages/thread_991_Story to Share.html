Reinhold is in an altoid box, magnatized to a metal wash basin, that has been moved around in the nursery, but still holds his position.<br>
Last week I was told, thank you Kelsung, the box was in plain view...he was no longer "under cover" <br>
So I stopped in a couple days later to look for him. Finally had to ask the owner where the basin was & she said it was sold. In my mind I was already crying over his loss, but calmly asked...did you see a box attached to the basin? She smiled & said yes.<br>
GREAT I'm thinking!!...she has it. <br>
She said the couple who bought it noticed it first & after reading through the contents decided to take it with them & investigate this hobby. She said she would have kept it thinking the owner, me, would have come for it eventually...but she knew the couple buying it, said they were fun people & were excited to check it out.<br>
So I'm sad it's gone, but content to know that maybe we'll have a couple newbies soon, & hopefully Reinhold will resurface again!!<br>
