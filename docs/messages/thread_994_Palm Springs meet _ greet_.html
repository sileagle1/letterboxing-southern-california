&gt; &gt; Looks like I might be able to come too.  I think I will be dropping Marco off at the grandparents in Rancho Mirage that day.  He has no school all week.  Probably will just make the meet and greet though.<br/>

Does anyone know for sure whether dogs are allowed in the park? I scoured the P&amp;R website and couldn't find anything. <br/>

If you have a chair for yourself..bring it :)<br/>
<br/>
I have a 6ft folding table(as does Pappasky) &amp; I have 4 camping chairs to bring...so I think we'll be fine to create our own place to congregate!<br/>
Looking forward to tomorrow...HAPPY SATURDAY!!!<br/>

Sadly, not according to this list.  But I don't know for certain if that means they are NOT allowed at all.<br/>

<br/>
There is a new dog run/enclosure at the park that may or may not be listed on the park site.<br/>
<br/>
Where the tables and benches are is a mere few feet from this enclosure which is by the way, a stones throw away from the new animal shelter and subsequently a new box!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am at this park often and see dogs all the time in this, the most easterly part of the park.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect some of you may see this sooner than others, so if it is Monday or Tuesday when it comes to you so sorry for the delay.<br/>
