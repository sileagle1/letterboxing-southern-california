We'll be celebrating Veteran's Day this morning with our Troop's chartering organization... opening their church service with the flag ceremony and helping throughout... <br/>

Sounds too CHILLY to me!  I'm sure my attitude is unlikely to change a month from now... when I will be camping at TRASK on 12/7-9/12, and I'm sure it will be C-O-L-D.<br/>
<br/>
My hubby did Desert Caravan once, and his motto for that is "Never Again."<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know... we're all wusses... Raised camping, I was... but mostly BEACH camping (and in the summer)!<br/>
<br/>
Brrrr.... cold, just thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Veteran's Day, everyone!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I sure wish our Troop did Veteran's Day celebration's - for some reason they have stopped doing pretty much any Community Service and I don't know why and certainly don't like it.  <br/>
 <br/>
One of my most poignant Veteran's Day memories, for me, was pulling the wagon with all of our Packs supplies, down the side of the parade route - It was the first real Veteran's Day parade we had in this area in decades.  The sidewalks were almost impassable due to the amount of onlookers, many of whom were Veteran's and their families - our Pack had made a decision to march on their own and not with the District group, each of our older boys carried a full size American Flag and the younger boys carried smaller flags representing each branch of the service - there weren't many of us, but as we made our way down the route - out of the crowd started stepping women thanking us for being there, these women were all wearing Blue Stars.  That amazed me enough, but what made tears come to my eyes, and still does, is when the Mom's wearing Gold Stars came out and thanked us . . . they were thanking us??  We should have been thanking them.<br/>
 <br/>
I am all for a beach camp-out!!  And would love to suggest El Capitan???  <br/>
 <br/>
OA you wimp you!!  ha ha - Trask is above snowline and I imagine it will be cold - especially if it snows :-P<br/>
 <br/>
We are going out to Death Valley after Christmas - now that's cold!!! <br/>
