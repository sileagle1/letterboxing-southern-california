that all the Jacksons visited Heritage Park today and just missed the<br/>
hitchhiker by 1 day. Darn. Thanks for the boxes there, keep on planting, you<br/>
have got some nice locations.  Congrats to Jelly on her birthday.<br/>
We visited a box in Idaho that was planted on our Grandson's birthday.  It<br/>
makes boxing even more special, Gwen<br/>

&gt; &gt; *sniffle* Sorry, just mourning box 3 still being missing. The Strange<br/>
&gt; Stamps<br/>
&gt; &gt; series has been our favorite to collect so far and often is the first we<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggest families with young kids go after - the location is so wonderful<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; more than just boxing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Doh!    That's a lesson to me!  Even though this series is only 10 minutes<br/>
&gt; up the 605 Fwy. from me, I haven't gone after it!  And now one is missing.<br/>
&gt; : (<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And the Whittier Semi-Mystery is gone too?! *sniffle* Be sure and holler<br/>
&gt; &gt; when you re-plant that one - we liked the location enough to go back and<br/>
&gt; &gt; find the box a second time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another hop-skip-and-jump away box I missed.  :`(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We've gotten 1 of the Eaton Canyon boxes, Buzzard :) We just got hot,<br/>
&gt; mildly<br/>
&gt; &gt; cranky and made the mistake of going on a popular day - Memorial Day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That's how it ended up for us.  Hot and cranky, made even worse by going<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; the way to the end of Eaton Canyon to find the Hummingbird box missing.  :<br/>
&gt; (  We started working the series backwards.  We started with the box<br/>
&gt; furthest in and were going to work our way back out which is not how<br/>
Buzzard<br/>
&gt; intended us to do it.  ; )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The ones up in Arrowhead are good for these hot days the next few<br/>
months.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rock Camp was a blast to visit, even without the box, and the creativity<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; hiding place for the Arrowhead Overlook...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yowza!  Last time I looked (albeit, back in March) there were no boxes in<br/>
&gt; the Arrowhead/Big Bear area.  Now I see tons of them!  Someone has been<br/>
busy<br/>
&gt; up there!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We are all trying to think of good boxing names during our break from<br/>
&gt; &gt; hiding - I'm trying to keep it from being a slew of Pokemon character<br/>
&gt; names<br/>
&gt; &gt; though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck with Pokemon names!  When they get older, it'll be skate and<br/>
&gt; surfing names.  My son chose Osiris.  I was impressed with his knowledge<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; Egyptian mythology till I found it was a skate company and he wanted to<br/>
use<br/>
&gt; their logo for his stamp.  : )<br/>

&gt; That is bizzarre. Don and Gwen said the same thing.  I will look into it<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; see what I can find...<br/>

&gt; OK.  I think I fixes the issue.  Could someone check and let me know?  I<br/>
&gt; have a hard time telling since I see everything as Administrator.<br/>
